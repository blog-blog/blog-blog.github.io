This is the Digital Literacy Narrative (DLN) collection. 

The posts here were written for Arizona State University's Engligh 484, a class for incoming Writing Mentors for the [Writers' Studio](https://cisa.asu.edu/content/writers-studio) run by the [College of Integrated Sciences and Arts](https://cisa.asu.edu/).

A DLN is described in the assignment like this:
> Your project should include both narration and reflection: the story itself and your thoughts exploring the significance of your literacy journey. The main purpose of this project is to help you understand how complex and fraught with tensions and triumphs all of our literacy narratives are. It is meant to help you understand how context, access, and culture influence our paths to learning. In other words, your first priority is to select rich moments in your journey and weave them together to tell a relevant story about your literacy experiences, but you should also reflect on the story.

## [Part One](dln-1)
> We all have our secret desires and anxieties, our secret fantasies and perhaps our secret hates. This private literacy isn't much different than that. It's not that this literacy *can't* be public. It's just the current truth that it is not. Ask yourself, is there something about myself that I keep a secret, and I could tell others (probably with no repercussions), and yet I don't? If you can answer yes, then it is perhaps to you that I write.

## [Part Two](dln-2)
> Many of us in our lives will be required to compose an essay. Fewer of us will compose by ourselves. Some of these essays will be academic and impersonal. Some will be personal although some of us still won't feel any special connection to the work. I imagine you do, though. I imagine you do compose by yourself. Maybe you journal and keep a diary. Maybe you write fiction—maybe even fan fiction. Maybe you have your own personal academic pursuits. If you can answer that yes, you do write, then it is to you that I probably write.

## [Part Three](dln-3)
> … consider the potential consequences of your own words. They could rip someone down or they could build someone up. People give you trust when they share. Maybe you are among the subset of people that spontaneously extend trust in order to share vulnerable writing and reading. If you are, it is in fact to you that I write.
