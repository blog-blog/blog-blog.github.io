`WIP`

Summing it all up, what especially will stay with me after this class?

## Don't make assumptions
Module references: race, anti-racism (inoue talk), second-language (where 2nd L students might not want to be defined by that identity)

## Be equitable
accessibility

## Be engaged

## Be open
In particular when it comes to harmful, older teaching techniques. Students are all different, a teacher needs to be flexible, tolerant, accomodating
