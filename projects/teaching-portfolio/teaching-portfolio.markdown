Welcome to my teaching portfolio. This set of statements and reflections was built during my role as a Writing Mentor for the Writers' Studio at Arizona State University's College of Integrated Sciences and Arts. In this portfolio, I will reflect on my learning under various topics: tutoring theory, facilitating critical feedback, assessing instructional practices, and applying strategies among others

*NOTE: This portfolio is also not yet complete. The look of the site itself is under renovation, and I need to incorporate evidence and multimodal elements.*

## Teaching Statement
Life is political, and so the classroom is political. This does not mean that the classroom is partisan; however, students have all different life situations, all different identities, and belong to different groups. It is reality that some identities are valued over others in American society. To make the decision to equalize the value of identities and groups in the classroom is a political one. I believe it is just to recognize and be concerned with the inclusion and equity of students across all backgrounds. As a university, as teachers, as a Writing Mentor, it is our duty to include and accommodate all students. It is then a teacher who engages and is generous that equalizes the classroom. Teaching requires someone who is receptive of, interested in, and cognizant of differences. It requires someone willing to teach all people and willing to support those who are under-valued. Instilling knowledge, fostering dialogue, and expanding horizons is, dare I say it, radical. Teaching students empowers them to act, to be aware, and to be awake to the world's currents of power.

Of course, teaching—not only political—is also practical. Teachers can forward these goals by XYZ. AKA, this is my literal personal approach
