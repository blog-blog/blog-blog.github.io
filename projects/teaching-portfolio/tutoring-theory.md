My role as a writing mentor is built off peer-tutoring theories. My learning here is the most obvious as I have done informal tutoring in the past. Under informal, I include helping a friend with a paper, with an assignment, with proof-reading. 

In high school, for example, I would be asked to help proof read. In a sense, my roll was Grammarly but with a sole. Sometimes, this is as much as I'd offer, being busy. However, I think the approach I took drained both my time and my friends', and it was ultimately detrimental. I wasn't attempting to teach or mentor, but I could have saved myself the effort by teaching. I would go through and iron out any clunky sentence, any formatting error, and any grammatical mistakes. This is problematic for multiple reasons (such as imposing an 'Ideal Text'^[Brannon-Knoblauch-SomePageNumberIHaveToCheck]).

In this situation, I could have instead identified a common grammatical issue, taught and explained the fix, and then stated that it happened elsewhere in the essay.

Without knowing it had a name, I had already been giving students *end comments*. Cooper, Bui, and Riker recommend this in their "Protocols and Practices"^[endnote-citation]. This gives closure and gives the student a sense of empowerment and confidence.

![Document comment reading: Of course, I’m not the one grading it, but I think you’ve done a really good job with your profile. This is exactly the kind of work we love to see in this class. I know you had concerns about flow, repetition, and making sense, and I think you already nailed the first two, and with the making sense, you did well with that as well. One suggestion I have, though, is to explain some parts more. My first comment is one example. Another example is your 4th paragraph. To me it makes sense: you’re talking about the great success of the career summit, and this obviously helps the community. I suggest though to add a final sentence to the paragraph that can act as a ‘paragraph conclusion.’ For example something like, “Events like the Career Summit are a great success for the community because XYZ.” If you like this suggestion, see if any of your other paragraphs could use a concluding sentence!](/assets/media/018.png)

In fact, I used this method in my first ever asynchronous workshop in the Writers' Studio. For context, ASU has an [InScribe](https://www.inscribeapp.com/) instance where students can solicit feedback on their projects from all the Mentors in the Studio.

To the right is my end comment to the student. I additionally employed my above strategy. (Though, note that the Writers' Lab is unconcerned with grammar; however, this student was requesting help).

`WORK IN PROGRESS`

I'm left with some pieces of important points when it comes to tutoring:


- Try to create an environment "within  which the  student  can  make  choices  and  take  ownership  of his or her writing" (Hug 3) ... Do not move "the  draft  only  in  the  direction  of  [my] interpretation,  creating  one  possible  future  for  the work  and  closing  off  possibilities  for  other  'realities'" (Hug 1)
- Self correct and don't impose any mental "Ideal Text" (from Brannon and C.H. Knoblauch)
- Understand a student's intent so that I can help them revise their paper towards their original intent (ibid)
- Do not overmark students' essays
- Recognize the problematic nature of a "standard" and the whiteness of US Academic style
- XYZ etc ...
