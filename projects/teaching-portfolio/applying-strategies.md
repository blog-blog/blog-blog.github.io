[Image of Module 3 Announcement]

My most practical outcome because much of what I've learned in doing this is through practice.

Creating better announcements, resources, reaching out to students better, better feedback, etc.

Here's an example of announcement: (Ill want to make this an image probably)

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I've finished grading the discussion assignment, so make sure to check out your grade and feedback. It's great to see all the effort put into the design decisions for the portfolios.</p>
<p>If you received feedback that your link was not made public, make sure to fix it, and then email me letting me know!</p>
<p>Now, I want to take a moment now to talk about considerations web designers make and how that relates to rhetorical situation. Companies and websites exist in a context and have targeted audience. This influences page layout, fonts, and colors. I've got three examples: a news site, a chat software, and a payment processor.</p>
<p>For example, look at the home page of <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/courses/203656/files/96559068/preview" alt="Image of the New York Times's homepage" width="780" height="360" /></p>
<p>They have a historical context of being a print-oriented news agency. It makes sense they would choose a <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serif font</a> and keep their color scheme black-and-white. It matches their historical identity, and it is what their audience has come to expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider now a homepage like <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/courses/203656/files/96559117/preview" alt="Image of Discord's homepage" width="780" height="360" /></p>
<p>Their website has a bold font and bold colors. Their targeted audience is primarily gaming communities, so they want to seem playful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A combination of these two contexts may be a website like <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/courses/203656/files/96559159/preview" alt="Image of Stripe's homepage" width="780" height="360" /></p>
<p>Stripe handles online payments for businesses. (Chances are, if you've bought things online, you've gone through Stripe.) They want to look modern, so they go with a san-serif font, and they're also colorful. However, they still look sleek and professional.</p>
<p>With your own digital portfolios, consider your font and color. How can these two aspects represent you personally or represent the rhetorical situation of your portfolio?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, if you have any questions about any feedback I've left or anything in general, please contact me.</p>
