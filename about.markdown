I'm a student of Philosophy (Morality, Politics, and Law) and Spanish at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). Previously, I've attended [Joliet Junior College](https://jjc.edu/) and [Central Arizona College](https://centralaz.edu/). At ASU, I also work at the College of Integrated Arts and Sciences in the Writers' Lab as a [Writing Mentor](https://cisa.asu.edu/writing-fellows). (I'm also a Walmart cashier—keeps me humble).

My interests include reading, writing, playing video games, baking, and [making game art](../projects/gameart). I used to live in Illinois, and I graduated from a high school of less than 200 students. After graduating May of 2023, my family and I moved to Arizona. I love the aesthetic of winter and Christmas, and sadly Arizona is a desert!

I'm also interested in free and open source software (foss). Foss is forms the backbone of much of the internet (most of the world's servers run on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)). I take an interest in a few communites, but in particular I'm most interested in [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). Fun fact, the learning management system Canvas, which is used by ASU, is open source. 

Perhaps I'll add a section about politics in the future… However, after graduating with a Bachelor's from ASU, I plan to master in Public Policy. Politics is a major motivator in my life.

There's much to say about myself, but this is some of the basics.
