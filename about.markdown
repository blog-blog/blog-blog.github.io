I'm **Mr. Breakfast**, a human and a web-user.

I work as a Writing Mentor with Arizona State University's [Writers' Studio](https://cisa.asu.edu/content/writers-studio), an online, first-year college composition program. At the Studio, I work as a course-embedded tutor (tutoring, interacting, and meeting with students) and a teacher's assistant (grading, announcing, and assortment of other tasks). You can learn more about my experience as an educator with my [Teaching Portfolio](/portfolio/teaching).

I'm also a student of Philosophy (Morality, Politics, and Law) and Spanish at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). After graduating, I plan to master in Urban Planning. 

In the future, I see myself working as an Urban Planner, policy analyst, or in a research-related job.

I live in Arizona, having moved here in 2023.

## I've also got lots of interests.

You can read more about them in my blog, [*Vanilla Abstract*](/blog).

I also make [art](/gallery). This has included pixel art, vector art, and 3D graphics. I've published [one project](https://mrbreakfastsdelight.itch.io/mr-breakfasts-free-prompts) into the public domain for anyone to freely use.

Speaking of free use, I also have an interest in free and open-source software (FOSS). I'm an avid lurker in the [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) community, a Linux desktop environment.

I'm supportive of the human, and as humans, we all need rest and expression and fullfillment. So I also read, write, play video games & D&D, make video games, and excercise other forms of expression. Recently I've been reading my way through Sir Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ and inching my way into becoming a full-blown *Star Wars* fan.
