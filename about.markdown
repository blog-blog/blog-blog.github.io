I'm a **Writing Mentor** with Arizona State University's [Writers' Studio](https://cisa.asu.edu/content/writers-studio), an online, first-year college composition program. At the Studio, I work as a course-embedded tutor (tutoring, interacting, and meeting with students) and a teacher's assistant (grading, announcing, and assortment of other tasks). You can learn more about my experience as an educator with my [Teaching Portfolio](/portfolio/teaching).

I'm also a student of Philosophy (Morality, Politics, and Law) and Spanish at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). After graduating, I plan to master in Public Policy. 

In the future, I see myself working as a policy analyst or a research-related job. I would love to work for Arizona's legislature, other state agencies, or advocacy organizations.

I've previously attended [Joliet Junior College](https://jjc.edu/) and [Central Arizona College](https://centralaz.edu/).

I live in the Phoenix area, having moved from Illinois in 2023.

## I've also got lots of interests.

Currently, I'm researching and writing an article for publishing. It focuses on a novel interpretation of Harriet Jacobs' _Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl_. You can read more about that [in my blog](/).

I also make [game art](../portfolio/game-art). This has included pixel art, vector art, and 3D graphics. I've published [one project](https://mrbreakfastsdelight.itch.io/mr-breakfasts-free-prompts) into the public domain for anyone to freely use, under the alias _Mr. Breakfast_.

Speaking of free use, I also have an interest in free and open-source software (FOSS). FOSS forms the backbone of the internet and is often relied upon by propriety software.[^1] FOSS is freedom to express, modify, and share. FOSS is also political. [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) writes, "The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works."

I'm also an avid lurker in the [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) community, a FOSS Linux desktop environment, even having submitted design documents.

Fun fact, the learning management system Canvas, which is used by ASU, is open source.

I'm supportive of the human, and as humans, we all need rest. So I also read, write, and play video games. I've been reading Sir Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_, but for non-fiction, I recommend Angela Chen's _Ace_. Additionally, from time to time I bake, watch a TV series, and spend some time on Youtube or social media.
