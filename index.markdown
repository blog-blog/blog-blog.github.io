Welcome to the Cabinet. It's sort of dark and dingey, but it's sort of cozy too.


To learned a little more about me, head over to the [About](about) page. But for the curious, I'm a student at Arizona State University studying Philosophy and Spanish. I have an interest in Public Policy as well. This is all in addition to navigating a life transitioning from one stage to the next. Suffice to say, don't think I've got it all figured out just because I've set up a blog.


I hope you enjoy your stay.
