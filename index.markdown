**Welcome to the Cabinet** 

It's sort of cozy in here, what, next to the vanilla and spice.

To learn a little more about me, head over to the [About](about) page. 

Briefly, I'm a **Writing Mentor** with Arizona State University's [Writers' Studio](https://cisa.asu.edu/content/writers-studio), an online, first-year college composition program. At the Writers' Studio, I work as a course-embedded tutor (tutoring, interacting, and meeting with students) and a teacher's assistant (grading, announcing, and assortment of other tasks). You can learn more about my experience as an educator with my [Teaching Portfolio](portfolio/teaching).

I'm also a student at ASU studying Philosophy and Spanish with an interest in Public Policy. In the meantime, I write for my blog [Vanilla Abstract](/#Vanilla Abstract), and I'm a [game artist](portfolio/game-art).

I hope you enjoy your stay. Have a look aroundâ€”I might recommend checking out my [Digital Literacy Narrative](portfolio/dln) project for English 484, a required course for beginning mentors.

# Vanilla Abstract
This is my blog. It's a play on [abstracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)) and, of course, [vanilla extract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPauR6tP_cg).

Here, we'll cover any of my topics of interest: open-source software, politics, books, and anything I write with a public audience in mind.
