A brawler game in a falling sand simulation, manipulate the elements! Built in [Bevy](www.bevyengine.org) with the bespoke library [powdered_bevy](), find the code repository on [GitHub]().

Here are some work in progress images.

## Falling Brawler
A [Noita](https://noitagame.com/)-like proto-Bending Brawler, this was an eventually scraped project.

## Majimo!
Going through many, many design iterations, this is an RTS tower-defense game with an algorithmic spell system.
