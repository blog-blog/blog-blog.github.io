I believe the classroom is political. Everyone deserves an education, and everyone deserves a *good* education—one where their identity, group, or ability does not devalue them. In fact, the classroom is not equal. In terms of resources, the classroom is not equal.[^1] In the value of Englishes, the classroom is not equal.[^2] In the methods of appraising writing, the classroom is not equal.[^3] And in terms of ability, the classroom is not equal.[^4]

[^1]: In relation to the ways segregation and under-funding affects oppressed groups of Americans (Hannah-Jones).
[^2]: "Yes, the ways we judge language form some of the steel bars around our students and ourselves -- we too maintain White supremacy, even as we fight against it in other ways." (Inoue)
[^3]: In relation to the ways rubrics can fail students and their writing identities (Balester).
[^4]: In relation to the ways tutoring and instruction can exclude or 'other' students with disabilities (Rinaldi).

I believe it is the duty of educators to equalize the classroom. The Writers' Studio strives to be equal. It is our duty to accommodate all students. When are aware of the inequalities of the classroom, we can bring balance to those imbalances. To do this, I value all Englishes equally, I attempt to make all me teaching resources accessible with alt-text and captions, and I recognize that student backgrounds inform their writing. To attack writing is to attack the person. Differences are not to be ironed out, nor are grammatical errors meant to be corrected. I am willing to support the undervalued. A teacher ideally empowers students to act and to challenge the inequalities they face. If a student were to engage me directly or indirectly about a harmful practice, it is not my place to be defensive.

In this vein, I believe teaching is about growth and the willingness to change. I can't stay stagnant. If I stayed exactly the same as I was five months ago (the time that I started), I would not be radically different, but I would be less effective. If I did not reflect following my one-on-one meetings with students, I would continue to be less confident in my abilities, and my abilities would be worse than they are now. By engaging with theories of teaching (such as the works above), I can learn more about helpful and equalizing practices that do more to actually educate the student.

I believe content matters more than form. In order to support all Englishes, we cannot use rubrics that build criteria for "grammar" or "style." While there is a "standard" U.S. Academic grammar, this standard is not always the best form. This can depend on the student's or the project's context. Proper mechanics are also subjective. For example, the layout of an essay might be front-loaded with a summarative introduction and concise thesis statement in the American university. Elsewhere, however, essays may take on a more organic approach with the argument slowly fleshed out and culminated in the conclusion. Is the latter incorrect just because I'm not used it it? I believe the answer is no. Some students will want to learn the standard academic style: they might be budding scientists or philosophers. Even then, we must encourage students to keep their voice. Not all students will go on to write—and maybe not even in their college career. However, every student can have a voice or an expression. In English 101, we can begin to draw this out, but only if we care for content, not form.

I believe dialogue is vital for learning. If students feel they can talk with me, they are more likely to receive help. Do you not understand? I can explain. Do you find writing this assignment hard? I can help. As a course-embedded and *peer* tutor, I can only tutor if there's an open conversation. Simply instructing a student is not enough. For my help to be applicable, we need to mutually engage in it and we need to practice it together. Additionally, I can't read minds, and so if the student feels they cannot ask questions or even question my answers, the help is abruptly halted. Tutoring is a branching process and one that is facilitated by dialogue.
