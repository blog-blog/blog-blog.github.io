title: Assessing Learning and Instructional Practices
permalink: portfolio/teaching/instructional-practices

We must continually evaluate our own instructional practices and the wider institutional practices. Sometimes we can evaluate simply be reflecting on the effectiveness of a strategy. For example, I found it was effective to message students when they do not submit an assignment. I found it effective to reflect on my performance in student meetings in order to improve. Other times, we must dive deeper into the issues and learn about issues at hand. By simply reflecting, would I identify the systemic errors of certain practices? How would I know the best way to give feedback?

## Critiquing the Classroom
We shouldn't provide feedback from a context of ignorance, so we must examine the ways in which the U.S. Classroom influences norms and how other groups and identities are at odds with those norms.

> "The very foundation of writing center theory is based on the idea of a conversation between two equals—a space in which we construct knowledge together as peers, not instruct from a position of power." (Rinaldi)

Kerri Rinaldi writes that the Writing Center "… still views disability as a deviation from the norm and students with disabilities as the other." Likewise, we can view other groups of people positioned in a similar way: "How can we incorporate the "others" into our mainstream?" This is not the correct approach. Rinaldi also suggests that, for disabled students, disclosure is not necessary. Similarly, the *Oxford Guide for Writers* says that, "some [multilingual] writers might not volunteer this aspect of their identities." [^OGWT-34]. We can interpret this to mean two things:

1. Students have ownership over their own identities. It is for them to divulge or not to divulge.
2. Students are individuals, and while "group membership" is sometimes readily apparent, this is not an excuse to assume or to pre-judge.

[^OGWT-34]: (Brannon and Knoblauch 34)

Altogether, the classroom assumes a monolith, or at the very least it attempts to impose a monolith. We combat this in many ways. As previously said, we recognize ownership, and we don't assume. Specifically, we recognize the importance and value of other Englishes: whether that be multilingual writers, Black writers, queer writers, female writers, etc.

We must recognize that the way we appraise writing can fail these goals. We mostly use rubrics for standardization and to signal the ideal "good writing." Instead, rubrics should appraise content with rhetorical awareness—both of the student's audience and their style and background. We must be aware of the societal context in which we grade—the context of "power, politics, and economics"[^Balester-1] and the values of U.S. Academic Writing ("efficiency and directness")[^OGWT-63].

[^Balester-1]: (Balester 1)
[^OGWT-63]: (Brannon and Knoblauch 62)

Academic discourse is "arbitrary, fluid, and subject to constant change" [^denny-73], so it is wrong to teach students they must be standard in order to be successful. We must recognize the hierarchies, and move away from them.

## Critiquing Myself

Where do I fall in all this? Of course, I don't make the curriculum, neither do I grade the writing assignments. However, I do interact with and tutor students. In my interactions, it would then be improper for me to forward my conception, or the academy's perception, of "good writing." 

Additionally, it's not the purpose of the Writers' Studio's ENG 101 to critique grammar. It grades the writing process. For example, when student's turn in their "Revised Draft" of the project after the "Rough Draft," part of the rubric is the presence of revision, not the presence of perfection.

When interacting with students, it's important I don't bring in assumptions that could hinder my helpfulness. I ask what the student needs help with: what their instructor says and what the student says. I don't attempt to overhaul their work. Again, tutoring is a conversation.

Being a young tutor (often the youngest or one of the youngest in the class), it's easy to feel that my help will be dismissed *because* I'll be viewed as inexperienced. Now, I have the job because I have more experience with the class and (probably) more experience with writing than the students. At the very least, it makes me less confident, which in turn makes me less helpful. At worst (which has never happened), it would make me unnecessarily defensive.[^1] This has never happened, and so I must let this assumption go in the same way we must let institutional assumptions go.

This is a lesson in the ways assumptions come to us: fear, self-consciousness, ignorance. And so with engaging with critical works and with reflection, we can overcome any (and especially harmful) assumptions.

[^1]: Unnecessary because what the student does or does not do with my help is not determined by me. Let be what will be.
