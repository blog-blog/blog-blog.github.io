Welcome to my teaching portfolio. Sometimes it is hard to find time to properly reflect, yet reflection is an important part of life, especially for improving skills. Here I will reflect on my first semester as a Writing Mentor with Arizona State University's [Writers' Studio](https://cisa.asu.edu/content/writers-studio). Also know that this can be a living document, continually refined and updated as my experiences and knowledge grow.

Tutoring is a great professional opportunity. Not only do I work with a wide variety of people, I also build professional relationships with instructors and other colleagues. I get to use professional software like [Slack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)), [Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)), and [Workday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workday,_Inc.). I also get to develop resources for students, like infographics and presentations. As a Writing Mentor and student employee, I largely must organize my own time, managing both school work and labor work. Finally, I get to be involved with the learning process, helping students learn and grow their skills.

The [Writers' Studio](https://cisa.asu.edu/content/writers-studio) is an online first-year composition program. We often have students who are service members or who already have jobs or a family. A [Writing Mentor](https://cisa.asu.edu/writing-fellows) is a course-embedded tutor and a teacher's aide. I grade some assignments (such as peer-reviews and discussion posts), but much of my duties revolve around helping students. I provide feedback on writing assignments and large projects if needed. I host writing revision workshops, answer questions in ASU's student forum, and make class announcements providing resources and explanations. Above all else, I tutor students, trying my best to help them succeed.

This portfolio began as the capstone project for ASU's ENG 484. This class is required for new Writing Mentors. Additionally, with my time in ENG 484, I have written a [Literacy Narrative](/portfolio/dln) and engaged with many critical works on topics such as accessibility, race, and multilingual writers.

Here we center on what I've learned as a Writing Mentor, tutor, and educator with ASU.
