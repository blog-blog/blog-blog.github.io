title: Reflecting on Emerging Practice

My Writing Mentor practice, at time of writing, has emerged over five months: from August to December 2024. In that time, I've had two sessions and four classes. I also have been taking ENG 484, the required course for new mentors. Through training and through [experience](/portfolio/teaching/gaining-experience), I've learned a lot over these five months, so what will stay with me?

## Mindset for Feedback and Interactions

Essentially everything I do for the Writing Studio is feedback and interaction, so what I've learned in this area will continue to be useful. I reflected on this mostly in [Assessing](/portfolio/teaching/instructional-practices) and [Facilitating Feedback](/portfolio/teaching/facilitating-feedback), and my end-point is summed up there. But how has it evolved over the semester?

In the beginning, my approach towards feedback and interaction was mostly the same as it is now: minimizing authority imbalance, being helpful, focusing on content and not style. However, now I have sources that can articulate these strategies written by people more knowledgeable than me in education theory. I've also gotten more efficient at providing feedback. The screenshot to the right shows my feedback to a fake student in a mock training. What I say is quite useful, but I could make it more concise and better organized.

I do that now.

## Authority and Power in the Classroom
As a course-embedded and *peer* tutor my role is not to have more *authority* than a student, but to have more *experience* than a student. My experience allows me to help them throughout the course. My attitudes towards power comes from the ASU _Writing Mentor Guide_ and some other works such as Rachel Stroup's writing about sexism in the writing center and Asao B. Inoue's speech about systemic racism in teaching practices.

In the beginning, my attitude towards authority and power was largely the same, just less articulated. Reading through the critical works assigned by ENG 484, I've come to see the specifics in how prejudice and power can affect the student-instructor and student-tutor relationship. Even the student-student's work relationship can be degraded by power.

This is why the student's authority over their own work must be affirmed. I can give good advice, but I don't dictate.

Power—and the lack of it—can affect identities and groups of students. Some may be privileged and other undervalued. I can mitigate this in the classroom by recognizing this imbalance and not perpetuating it.

## The Future
I will want to continue gaining experience and reflecting on my practice. I especially want to continue improving my face-to-face tutoring skills as that is my only source of inconfidence. I'm at a state currently where I *am* helpful, but I still see room for improvement. Some of this requires more experience, but I think I will need to engage more with the *Oxford Guide for Writing Tutors* and other practical guides like "Protocols and Process" and *About Responding to Student Writing*.

There's always a way to improve engagement, interest, and performance perhaps through feedback, resources, dialogue, and other strategies. I will keep an open mind to new theories about tutoring practices. My time with the Writers' Studio and as an educator will be informed by the students. What is best for the students will be incorporated into my practices.
