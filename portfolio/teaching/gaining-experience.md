Gaining experience, above all else, is perhaps the most important part of being an educator or educational mentor. Having gained experience, I can say this.

There is much to be said about preparation. As a new Writing Mentor for [ASU's Writers' Studio](), I was without any pedogogical training. This is the point of employers training, of course. But I wanted to specifically point out that while I had developed writing skills, I had essentially no development with teaching.

## Soft Experience
While practical experience is important,  so is reading the theory.

I look to Peter Elbow's "About Responding To Student Writing" for my approach in giving feedback where he says, "We can write comments that are at least true … even if they are true only for one reader." To me, this means that I can give my commentary on a student's work, but I know that I am not "all-knowing." I can also admit, though, that I have a decent eye and ear, and so my commentary is valuable and can be litmus test for the student.

In my time with the Writing Mentor instructional course, we read a lot of works centered on various groups of people and their relationship to the dominant US Academic culture. Without training like this, it's unlikely I'd ever gain these necessary perspectives. As I gain experience, there is room to [apply these methods](/portfolio/teaching/applying-strategies), room to grow, room to improve.

The class is the theory, the job is that theory in practice. Whenever there is that conversion, some things get thrown out the window some things demonstrate their value, but altogether, it makes me like the job more. How satisfying is it to help people? I found, though, that while preparation is important, it is not everything. At some point, of course, that practice needs to be—well—put into practice. The best of example of this is **Individual Workshops**. 

## Practical Experience

Because the Writers' Studio is online, as a course-embedded tutor, I meet from time-to-time with students through Zoom. Most communications happen through Canvas messages or email, but for synchronous workshops (a meeting where students can receive help with the writing project) we meet face-to-face virtually.

I had never tutored anyone in my life, and most of my experience with virtual meetings were with classes during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). I was quite anxious as I was preparing for my first workshop. My worst nightmare was, not only failing to help the student, but making the situation worse. I read over the relevant literature, solicited help from the instructor (telling her I felt unqualified), and then I had the meeting, and it went well.

After completing several synchronous and asynchronous workshops, I feel more confident in my ability to help students. With more confidence, it actually becomes easier to help because it is easier to communicate. I know a lot about the requirements of the project and the expectations of the instructor. This puts me in a place where I know more than the student. If I know more, it only requires me to communicate well in order to help.

After having now completed four workshops, I can point to a few self-directives:

1. Prepare (read the students' work, contemplate how to help, read the instructor's feedback), but do not overprepare. You're not a script or a robot.
2. Ask the student questions about their work, their topic, how they feel. At the very least, the meeting should be a conversation.
3. Before signing off, quickly summarize the meeting. After, follow up on the meeting by sending an email summary of topics covered.[^ending-meeting]

## The Result
Gaining experience is helpful in another way: you develop tangible aids for your life. By this I mean: resources for students, templates for feedback, templates for announcements. Additionally, as someone who took their English 101/102 elsewhere, I had no idea how the Writers' Studio operated. Now I know the flow of the class. I know the due dates, the sequences, and I can anticipate what students will need. Practice makes closer to (but never *quite* to) perfect.

## Notes
[^elbow]: 
[^ending-meeting]: The *Oxford Guide for Writing Tutors* suggestions these very things: summarize and end with asking, "Any more questions?" (OGWT 49) Additionally, it is reccomend in "Protocols and Process in Online Tutoring" that tutors leave a summartive, encouraging 'end comment' to students' works (Cooper, Bui, and Riker 137). This also works for post-meeting follow-up emails.
