title: Facilitating Dialogue

As [previously mentioned](/profile/teaching/tutoring-theory), I believe it is important to be conversational when tutoring or interacting with students. There's no reason that tutors should be authoritative in a hierarchical manner. Like these students, I am also a student.

To facilitate dialogue, we need a conversational (or dialogic) approach. This partly means encouraging the student to respond to written suggestions or to encourage interaction when face-to-face.

Alyssa-Rae Hug explores a dialogic approach in "Two’s Company, Three's a Conversation" specifically in the realm of providing feedback. However, I think the lessons learned here are widely applicable. 

When Hug and the instructor collaborated on giving feedback to a student work, Hug said this collaboration

> … worked to diffuse the singular “monologue” teacher commentary can become and turn it into a dynamic dialogue among all of us—the professor, the student’s writing, and the writing fellow, and then eventually, the student-author.[^hug-6]

[^hug-6]: (Hug 6).

Notice the recognition of the student as the _author_. This provides the student a level of respect and authority over their own work—something important to remember when tutoring.


## Global Dialogue
Practically, this can be the tutor _initiating_ the conversation (the **global dialogue**). I'm distinguishing between a particular dialogue and a global dialogue because they happen somewhat differently. The former are singular instances that make up the global dialogue.

If I don't participate in a global dialogue, it won't make sense to the student when I participate in a particular dialogue. 

The global dialogue is begun when I introduce myself, it then continues when I participate in discussions, and provide feedback. 

An important part of refining a writing process is to participate _in_ the process, and there are ways I can help [engagement](/portfolio/teaching/applying-strategies).

When some students missed the first discussion, I was able to increase engagement and begin a dialogue with a missing assignment message.

I always offer that I'm available to help

## Particular Dialogue

An example of a particular dialogue is surrounding the student's 'Profile Project' in the Writers' Studio. This dialogue can begin before the rough draft is due with the student soliciting feedback. The dialogue continues with instructor feedback, my feedback in conversation with the instructor (pictured right), and then with face-to-face meetings.

I don't normally interact with the instructor's feedback as I do in the screenshot, but I do if the student needs help with implementing the feedback.

This builds a relationship. I'm working with the instructor and the student in order to help the student arrive at their ideal draft.

The dialogic approach then increases student ownership and responsibility. What I try to teach is better packaged in a conversation. As previously mentioned with the [scaffolding strategy](portfolio/teaching/tutoring-theory), whats talked about in a conversation is meant to last after the conversation is over. This means that with what I teach, I must teach it dialogically in order for it to mean anything once I finish talking. I'm here to help, not to dictate.
