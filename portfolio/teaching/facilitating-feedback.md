As a Writing Mentor, I make weekly announcements and give feedback to students nearly every week, and so I've built a repertoire of templates that help me provide this feedback.

Much of my strategies have come from ASU's _Writing Mentor Guide_[^1] and the instructors I'm paired with.

[^1]: The Writers' Studio *Writing Mentor Guide* is not publicly available.

Feedback should be constructive, not destructive. The wording should not appear to put down, but to communicate I'm appreciate of the work put in.

The _Guide_ recommends to give personalized, specific, content-focused, and contextual feedback. In figure (1), you can see that it's based on a template; however, there are spots to include personalizations. These personalizations are specific about what the student wrote, and I also connect this to their own projects (which is contextual feedback). By specific, any negative feedback must be targeted, otherwise the critique is not useful. How will the student know what to change if the critique is general?

The announcement in figure (2) is similar to the feedback I gave for the same assignment. I ask the student to use metacognition, which is important for an end-of-course assignment: "How can I make my revisions and skills applicable to the future?" I also relate the writing process for their project to the greater process of writing.

I often tell students something like, "It's better to begin and have anything than to have nothing," which is related to this quote:

>  I may write garbage, but you can always edit garbage. You can't edit a blank page. ([Jodi Picoult](https://www.npr.org/2006/11/22/6524058/jodi-picoult-you-cant-edit-a-blank-page))

Students might be scared of potential negative feedback. By always being constructive, I can ease these fears. I also let the student know they don't need perfect work, especially with rough drafts.

The _Guide_ also has best-practices for wording. In addition to this, an instructor of mine also gave me her theory for feedback:

The responsibility of the grade should be placed on the student. "To get a 3/3, do XYZ" not "I docked 2 points because you didn't XYZ." 

Additionally, while I do grade from a position of authority, I should do my best to minimize that imbalance. I try to word my feedback in a way that doesn't diminish work. I also reword until the feedback doesn't read as if I'm the "granter" of grades and the judge of perfect assignments.

Finally, I want to end with my favorite announcement. There's surely room for improvement, but I wanted to get students to think about the considerations of (web) designers. Their Digital Portfolios are created with a template but there is some room for customization. Considering the audience and message, why do some sites choose a certain font, design language, or color palette?
