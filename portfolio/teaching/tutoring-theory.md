title: Engaging with Composition and Peer-Tutoring Theories
permalink: /portfolio/teaching/tutoring-theory
---

My role as a writing mentor is built off peer-tutoring theories. My learning here is the most obvious as I have done informal tutoring in the past. Under informal, I include helping a friend with a paper, with an assignment, with proof-reading. 

In high school, for example, I would be asked to help proof read. In a sense, my roll was Grammarly but with a soul. Sometimes, this is as much as I'd offer, being busy. However, I think the approach I took drained both my time and my friends', and it was ultimately detrimental. I wasn't attempting to teach or mentor, but I could have saved myself the effort by teaching. I would go through and iron out any clunky sentence, any formatting error, and any grammatical mistakes. This is problematic for multiple reasons (such as imposing an 'Ideal Text'[^Brannon-Knoblauch-159]).

In this situation, I could have instead identified a common grammatical issue, taught and explained the fix, and then stated that it happened elsewhere in the essay. This would have been a more didactic approach, and one that leads to empowerment rather than the appearance that they're terrible at grammar.

## The Theory
There are many strategies to keep in mind when tutoring. A principal text for writing tutors is the _Oxford Guide for Writing Tutors_. As a Writing Mentor, there are maxims I should follow:

1. Be flexible in tutoring approach: vary your strategies because everyone learns differently.
2. Be ready to learn: you don't know all the answers, so it's better to have a culture of learning.
3. Reflect on practices and sessions .

It's important to recognize we don't tutor writing, we tutor people.[^Brannon-Knoblauch-12]

[^Brannon-Knoblauch-12]: (Brannon and Knoblauch 12)

As such, we must be aware _of_ the people. I strive to tutor with conversation: personal focus, listening, scaffolding,[^Brannon-Knoblauch-18] instructional, questioning, reading the work, commenting, reflecting, summarizing, but finally _helping_.

[^Brannon-Knoblauch-18]: (Brannon and Knoblauch 18). By scaffolding, I refer to a tutoring technique where the tutor begins by providing the student a temporary structure (using expertise to guide, engage, understand, breakdown tasks, and support). As the student learns, the tutor's active help is needed less and less.

In a similar manner to the way [institutions acknowledge indigenous land](https://lib.asu.edu/indigenous-land-acknowledgement), we must also recognize the power imbalances of instructional practices.

Much of what we teach is based on the institutional history and 'prestige' of U.S. Academic Writing, a history which often excluded women and non-white peoples. This causes U.S. Academic Writing to value efficiency and directness[^Brannon-Knoblauch-63], distance, and objectivity.

[^Brannon-Knoblauch-63]: (Brannon and Knoblauch 63).

This style could be at odds with other forms of writing, especially styles associated with unprivileged groups of people. How would we evaluate feminist philosophy like Gloria Anzaldúa's in this context? Black writers? Queer writers?

Sometimes we are tempted to forward the traditional style in the name of vocation: we teach in this way because it is what students need. But do students need the style, or simply the ability to properly express themselves?

I've just mentioned her, but [Gloria Anzaldúa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Anzald%C3%BAa) in reference to what the academy taught her, wrote that she has not "… yet unlearned the esoteric bullshit and pseudo-intellectualizing that school brainwashed into my writing." We must be aware of the white-washing[^1] imposing U.S Academic English can do.

[^1]: I think I'm often misinterpreted when I use the term _white wash_. While it _can_ refer to racial practices of oppression and forced conformity, it is not _only_ a racial term. It comes from white washing a fence or a wall, where the painter is removing any imperfections, any uniqueness. I use it in the more general sense.

If we, for example, enforce a rubric based on form and not content, we white-wash. Asao B. Inoue in his keynote speech to the [CCCC](https://cccc.ncte.org/), says,

> We must stop justifying White standards of writing as a necessary evil. Evil in any form is never necessary. We must stop saying that we have to teach this dominant English because it’s what students need to succeed tomorrow. They only need it because we keep teaching it!

I believe I have the duty to assess students based on intent and content, not their form, insofar as I can reasonably verify their form is clear to the writer's audience.[^clarity] It's important to confront systems of power, so we don't perpetuate those systems in the classroom.

Practically, I encourage students to keep their voice in their writing, even if I suggest content changes. I consciously appreciate style of writing that are written how the student probably writes.

[^clarity]: For a meta-philosophical discussion about clarity, I recommend James McGuiggan's "[Scientific, Poetic, and Philosophical Clarity](https://philarchive.org/rec/MCGSPA-6)"

## Practical Example

![Document comment reading: Of course, I’m not the one grading it, but I think you’ve done a really good job with your profile. This is exactly the kind of work we love to see in this class. I know you had concerns about flow, repetition, and making sense, and I think you already nailed the first two, and with the making sense, you did well with that as well. One suggestion I have, though, is to explain some parts more. My first comment is one example. Another example is your 4th paragraph. To me it makes sense: you’re talking about the great success of the career summit, and this obviously helps the community. I suggest though to add a final sentence to the paragraph that can act as a ‘paragraph conclusion.’ For example something like, “Events like the Career Summit are a great success for the community because XYZ.” If you like this suggestion, see if any of your other paragraphs could use a concluding sentence!](/assets/media/018.png)

For a moment we can focus on a real-world example of tutoring.

Without knowing it had a name, I had already been giving students *end comments*. Cooper et al. recommend this in their "Protocols and Process". The intention is that this gives closure and gives the student a sense of empowerment and confidence.

I made a point of using this method in my first ever asynchronous workshop in the Writers' Studio. For context, ASU has an [InScribe](https://www.inscribeapp.com/) instance where students can solicit feedback on their projects from all the Mentors in the Studio. The channel stays open for about two weeks, up until the due date of the project.

To the right is my end comment to the student. I employed the end comment strategy, ensuring I complimented the work, offered a summation, and a final suggestion that transitioned the student from "review mode" to "revision mode". It is actionable, directive, and useful (Note that the Writers' Studio is unconcerned with grammar; however, this student was requesting help).

## The Result
Finally, instructional and tutoring practices can either make or break the student experience. As educators, we can either cement the rigid 'ideal style' or help the student find their own voice.

I want to do that latter, and it means I take a subtler, more sensitive approach to suggestions, [dialogue](/portfolio/teaching/facilitating-dialogue) and [feedback](/portfolio/teaching/facilitating-feedback). It would be improper to forward my own world view through my own practices. Learning the theory surrounding the field of tutoring and education is an important tool in preventing this imposition. The theory highlights potentially problematic areas for tutors.

I will later assess my own [instructional and learning practices](/portfolio/teaching/instructional-practices) further.

## Notes
[^Brannon-Knoblauch-159]: (Brannon and Knoblauch 159). The 'Ideal Text' is the criteria from which a teacher grades or appraises a text. This has consequences for a student because rather than being appraised on real merit or intent, the student is judged based on a subjective mental scaffold. I keep this in mind whenever I review a student's work, checking my expectations against the merit of a student's intentions—_their_ ideal text.
