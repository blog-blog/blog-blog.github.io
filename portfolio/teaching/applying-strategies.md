title: Apply Strategies for Enhancing Interest, Motivation, Participation, and Performance
permalink: portfolio/teaching/applying-strategies

I've talked a lot about inclusivity, the importance of valuing differences, and refraining from assumptions. For creating motivation, participate, and performance, I employ two strategies which have helped so far:

1. Be personal
2. Create connections
3. Explain instructions

## Be Personal

In this message, I take on a more personal tone and begin a dialogue by inviting the student to class. I sent these out to students who had missed the deadline for the first discussion assignment. I didn't, however, do this in my first session. Overall, I didn't notice more long-term engagement. However, it did create communication with students who *did* continue to engage, so it was helpful for those students to know that they were seen and that I believed them important. I didn't get universal responses, but the responses I received help me understand the student's situations.

By being personal, I could *reach out* to students. That most effective forms are like the above: notifying students they can receive credit, letting them know I'm here to help, knowing that I'm open to communicate.

## Create Connections
By connections, I don't mean relationships (although that is important, of course.) What I mean is that it can be helpful to connect what is learned in class to a wider context. This can be seen with my announcement in "[Developing an Approach to Feedback](/portfolio/teaching/facilitating-feedback)" where I connect their portfolio designs to wider web design (or design considerations in general).

This (hopefully) creates interest by showing the applicability of topics. A student may question, "Why do I have to make a portfolio?" That needs to be be explained, but when we create connections, we can get students interested in the process and project themselves.

## Explain

I have much less experience with this strategy. This comes in an obvious form (explanations during writing workshops, for example) but also in less obvious (such as making infographics and presentations). So far, I've made one successful infographic (displayed to the right). Many students don't fully implement the 3CQ method (Comment, Compliment, Connect, Question) in their discussions, so the infographic acts as a reminder but in a different format.

I haven't fully determined the best way to go about this strategy. I assume that it's mostly about *different media*, in that the majority of instructions are in text, so an audio-visual medium might be appreciated as an alternative. By aiding understanding, this should eventually enhance performance as well.

Finally, a new class is an opportunity to experiment with applying new strategies. My applications will continually evolve and grow, becoming more useful in enhancing.
