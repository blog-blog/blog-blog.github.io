First, the book design is quite beautiful. The featured photograph does much of the heavy lifting, but the serif-font aids it, too, and the royal blue peeking out from under the jacket compliment the oranges and peaches in Diana's face and highlights the blue of her eye. I would call it (amongst the books I have read) second only to Emily Wilson's translation of Homer's *The Odyssey* and in the running with a particularly beautiful edition of J.R.R Tolkein's *The Hobbit*, which was from a local library and which had begun falling apartâ€”taped along the spine with green duct-tape, and with both of Claire Saffitz' cookbooks *Dessert Person* and *What's for Desert*, which are in and of themselves works of art. The interior layout and typography of *Dianaworld* are quite pretty and elegantly done. The paper also feels of nice quality.

The book is probably best read with some basic knowledge of Diana and her story, but Edward White does enough contextualization that you don't have to have read a biography on her. I was first introduced to Diana through my mom and grandma, who concieved of her as the People's Princess and as wronged by the Royal Family, even espousing the conspiracy theory that the family had her killed. I always doubted that the Royal Family would act so heinously, and it doesn't really make sense anyway.

Then I saw Diana dramaticized in Netflix's *The Crown*, which was quite enjoyable, and dramaticized history is somehow a favorite genre of mine. However, learning her history through a drama TV show is perhaps unrecommended. Then I remember being enamoured with her AIDS activism. And that's how I thought of Diana: supremely caring and wronged.

White's book is a disillusioned look at "Dianaworld" and the obession around her. I learned a lot about Dianaworld I hadn't known before, and I won't really get into it, because if you're interested, read it (and perhaps check it out from your library).

But it deconstucts what *my* illusions were and gave me a more grounded view of who she really was.

Really though, what kept me reading was White's writing, his quips, and his shade thrown. At times it is really quite funny.

## Verdict
I'm not really a non-fiction reader unless it's an article, and of the non-fiction I tend to read, I tend to not finish, my attention and desire petering out as I near the end. Now, *Dianaworld* is similar, but it held my interest enough to get past the finish line. If you're like me where the subject of the non-fiction must be something you're *already interested in*, then *Dianaworld* will keep you interested (if you're interested in Diana, but if you're not, then it won't). If you're a non-fiction reader, then you'll probably like it.

I think the deconstructing of an illusion is quite interesting, though, but I imagine if you're quite steeped in it, *Dianaworld* might even read as an attack. While reading it, I wondered if White was at times perhaps a bit *too* biting, but I was there for it. He didn't read as if her was particularly biased against her, however. He's just realistic.

I was drawn to the book because it was displayed front-out in the library's 'new' section, and I'm a small-minor Dianist. It met my expectations. Verdict: quite liked it, very illuminating, and funny. And above all, I wonder, *What is it with gay men and popular women and female characters?*
