Many of us in our lives will be required to compose an essay. Fewer of us will compose by ourselves. Some of these essays will be academic and impersonal. Some will be personal although some of us still won't feel any special connection to the work. I imagine you do, though. I imagine you do compose by yourself. Maybe you journal and keep a diary. Maybe you write fiction—maybe even fan fiction. Maybe you have your own personal academic pursuits. If you can answer that yes, you do write, then it is to you that I probably write.

Consider, what was the first work you ever wrote? Can you trace a line from that work to the works you write now? Do you feel attached to all that you write? Or maybe just the ones you have an emotional or time investment in?

## From First Grade to *A Story of Titles* to *The War of The Fire and The Creeping Cold*
When I was 7, I wrote a small booklet about a baby bird and his brother. I can't recall the plot, but I was able to find a related piece. Read it below.

It's sort of incoherent. Something about the baby bird needlessly disobeying his mom, feeling bad about it, and then writing her a mother's day card. This story isn't what's important though. From a young age I wanted to write. At one point I wanted to be an author.

While I was searching through my mom's archives, I found a lot of written work from me. I saw the journals that we made in first grade. I got to see all the spelling mistakes. But I also got to see little me attempting to tell stories. 

Later, I had a brief time with world building after having gotten into the fantasy genre. I would essentially write a wiki about a fictional world—or attempted to at least. I wouldn't call any of it especially good, and they were always unfinished, but I think it's a testament to creative expression nonetheless. Here's a map I drew at one point.

When I would creative write like this, I wouldn't share it with anyone. Obviously, when I was very young, anything I wrote was shared with my mom, and I didn't care. I remember one time in fourth grade, we had to write a reflection about some such thing—I don't remember the topic—and when it came my turn to read out loud what I had written, I didn't want to, and I cried. Even now, I'm not really sure why. It was just a reflection. I think I thought what I had written for my reflection was inadequate, and I feared judgment when sharing. Thankfully, my fourth grade teacher was understanding.

My relationship with publicizing my creative writing has always been fraught.

Fast forward some years later, and it's my sophomore year of high school. By then, COVID-19 restrictions had loosened, but I still wore a mask in public. I took a creative writing class that first semester.

We wrote in various formats and poem forms, and then it came to writing a short story. I had trouble coming up with an idea. I could think of somewhat interesting titles, but couldn't make a story behind them. One night as I was trying to sleep, I found it: I would write about an author with writer's block who could create titles but did not have it in him to actually write.

This became *A Story of Titles*. It spawned a cast of characters that I still write about and think about today. Some of them I know quite well, and others change with time. This is the origin of a loose anthology of growing stories that at one point I titled *The War of The Fire and The Creeping Cold*. It comes from the central metaphor in the story. I've since moved away from that, and now I just write semi-isolated stories set in the same time frame. It's during winter, but now I consider if I should perhaps save my characters from this ever-lasting winter…

On of the final paragraphs from *A Story of Titles* was this[^dew],

> He woke up the next morning to a faint buzzing. A hummingbird was drinking nectar outside his window. The leftover humidity of yesterday's warmth had condensed on the blades of grass outside, forming dew drops. The rising sun lit up every droplet as if it were a firefly. In result, the world outside his quaint study window was glistening with gold. From the opened parlor window, he picked up on the faintest sound of falling footsteps. It was a cool, crisp summer morning. The sky was clear and the air smelled fresh: the perfect prelude for a warm summer day. “Oh my,” when his eyes had sharpened, he looked down at his paper. On it was written many words. At the top he had created a title …

Then, in a bid to combine creative writing with academic writing, I would write this as the conclusion to my English 102 research paper,

> Finally, a warm breeze can part the clouds above the salty sea. There is a boat mooring into shore, and in the distance the peaks of great mountains stipple the horizon. There is a great depth below the ravaged sail, beneath the glimmering blue. The boat sails on to solid ground and so does linguistics, too. A breath of fresh air flows, flowing awash over dappled droplets. This battle has no redemption arc, no climactic final battle; it does not end with a bang but with a whimper, fading into irrelevance. Chomsky has largely gone the way of the Greek gods. The battle itself is unimportant to most, but what has emerged from the ashes is surely important to the scientists of the field. It has shown, unequivocally, that studying language gleans the most important information. The boat grounds, dredging a line in the pale sand. Waves wrought by the passed-storm lap onto shore. Dark clouds recede behind the soaring mountains, and shafts of light beam from above.

## Academic Writing: From Fahrenheit to Universal Grammar

I can trace my academic writing skills from an essay about the myriad possible interpretations of *Fahrenheit 451*'s message and the importance of authorial intent. This would lead to my Universal Grammar ENG 102 research paper and to my current papers.

The Universal Grammar essay, titled "Chomsky, Everett, and the Worth of Studying Languages," built a David-vs-Goliath narrative into a research paper. The intricate details of Universal Grammar and the scholarly battle that occurred are unimportant for our purposes (but if you're interested, the embedded video here does a good job in explaining).

This time with the research paper was one of great literacy growth. I learned to construct a narrative (although I had help with other sources, namely [Thomas Wolfe](https://harpers.org/archive/2016/08/the-origins-of-speech/)'s “The Origins of Speech: In the beginning was Chomsky” and [K Kelin](https://youtu.be/g14EvDDhgpE?si=dmGKEoXnlj5h4-ZX)'s "The Battle of the Linguists"). I learned to better organize an argument and to better integrate evidence. These skills are most helpful academically. Most importantly, however, I gained a better feel for my style, and I learned even more how to create a story.

This time was also one of my most content. I would spend midday in the school library, skipping PE (with consent) and lunch (which I'd eat in the library). Friends would join me, and we'd have a—largely unsupervised—fun time. Those days are now over, separated by time and 1700 miles of distance.

I'm fortune I had a talent for academic writing. I would struggle to improve and to do better than the previous. But I did not struggle with mechanics or organization or research in a meaningful way beyond "I'm learning new skills." At this time I would help friends though, so I'm still sensitive to the struggle of others.

## In Reflection
When it comes to me, much of what I write (for school at least) is really more ephemeral. I'm attached to my long, important essays, but I'm not attached to online discussion boards or other small written works. This is a combination of a lack of emotional investment and time spent.

Yet, for some, even those ephemeral works exposes them to criticism of skill or thought. For me, personal works—especially those with emotional investment and emotional vulnerability—are those that expose me.

Maybe you can relate, but if you can't, perhaps I've painted a picture you can step in to. Consider the possible vulnerabilities people expose themselves to when they share written work. No, my Universal Grammar essay is not a window into my soul, so I'd happily share it with anymore. But with my fictional work, I hardly share it at all.

School can't really force you to give your genuine reactions when reading, but if you write genuinely, and that work is an assignment, you've exposed a vulnerability. Writing, by the way we teach it, is more public. Therefore, writing is more exposed, even if many of us don't want it to be.

But my anecdotes prove something about this publicity. For many, especially for me, publicity has positive results. With compassionate teachers and friends, publicizing a work can be quite rewarding. It can grow relationships. In fact, with the next part of this DLN when I talking about being a Writing Mentor, it was because I shared my writing with teachers that I had the references for that job.

So as in the previous part I implored you to consider others' vulnerabilities when sharing their reading, consider, too, their vulnerabilities in sharing their writing.

## Endnotes
[^dew]: the 'glistening with gold' dew drops was sort of a self reference to a memory I had of my own backyard. The lawn awash with white clover, dew drops hung on grass, and the intense morning sun sparkled the water gold. Vivid imagery of this normally is derived from a memory, whether it be of Christmastime or a sunset.
