*Written for ASU's ENG 484 Writing Mentor Internship, this is first part of a three part Digital Literacy Narrative. Find here [part one](dln-part-one) and [part three](dln-part-three).*

With this post, I want to center the importance of writing. It might help to consider life without writing, or really, life without story telling. Whether it is fiction or non-fiction, I'm always trying to tell the reader some story. Sometimes this story is explicit, and sometimes it lurks behind the words. Sometimes… the story is in the motive.
## First Grade
Lets start from the very beginning, and don't judge me y'all, we're looking at something 6 or 7-years-old me made.

Notice the, uhh, grammatical inconsistencies. This story in particular isn't exactly the point, however. At first, it *was* the point I was going to make (look where I made my first story: the beginning of literacy!), but the point I want to make now is more contemporary.

While I was searching through my mom's archives, I found a lot of written work from me. I saw the journals that we made in first grade. I got to see all the spelling mistakes. But I also got to see little me attempting to tell a story. 

At this point of my life, it was more likely that a teacher would read to me than I would read myself. However, we did have a textbook, and I remember we would 'popsicle read', where the teacher would draw a popsicle stick from a cup and the stick had our names on them. I remember being told to sound words out.

I've split up reading and writing between two parts, but they're really intrinsically linked. They developed together. They coincided. Often times I will write because I'm inspired by what I read.
## *A Story of Titles*
After that in first grade, I would go on to write incomplete stories. I had a brief time with world building after having gotten into the fantasy genre. I would essentially write a wiki about a fictional world. I wouldn't call any of it especially good, and they were always unfinished, but I think it's a testament to expressing creation nonetheless. Here's a map I drew at one point.

We then have to wait until sophomore year of high school. This was right after the worst of COVID-19 although in public I still wore a mask. I took a creative writing class. I needed an elective, so I thought why not.

We wrote some poems and whatnot, and then it came to writing a short story. I could not think of a story. I would think of somewhat interesting titles, but couldn't make a story behind them. One night as I was trying to sleep, I found it: I would write about an author with writer's block who could create titles but did not have it in him to write.

This is one of the best ideas I've ever had. The short story was good, sure, but really the characters it spawned are the most important thing the story gave me. The characters are the events they're in act as metaphors for events in my life.

It's the final piece of vivid prose from *A Story of Tiles* that imposed on me a feeling of accomplishment.

> He woke up the next morning to a faint buzzing. A hummingbird was drinking nectar outside his window. The leftover humidity of yesterday's warmth had condensed on the blades of grass outside, forming dew drops. The rising sun lit up every droplet as if it were a firefly. In result, the world outside his quaint study window was glistening with gold. From the opened parlor window, he picked up on the faintest sound of falling footsteps. It was a cool, crisp summer morning. The sky was clear and the air smelled fresh: the perfect prelude for a warm summer day. “Oh my,” when his eyes had sharpened, he looked down at his paper. On it was written many words. At the top he had created a title …

Then, a year later I would write,

> Finally, a warm breeze can part the clouds above the salty sea. There is a boat mooring into shore, and in the distance the peaks of great mountains stipple the horizon. There is a great depth below the ravaged sail, beneath the glimmering blue. The boat sails on to solid ground and so does linguistics, too. A breath of fresh air flows, flowing awash over dappled droplets. This battle has no redemption arc, no climactic final battle; it does not end with a bang but with a whimper, fading into irrelevance. Chomsky has largely gone the way of the Greek gods. The battle itself is unimportant to most, but what has emerged from the ashes is surely important to the scientists of the field. It has shown, unequivocally, that studying language gleans the most important information. The boat grounds, dredging a line in the pale sand. Waves wrought by the passed-storm lap onto shore. Dark clouds recede behind the soaring mountains, and shafts of light beam from above.

## Universal Grammar
That passage was the final paragraph of my first ever research paper. It would also be the last essay I would write in high school and before moving away from Illinois.

I was quite ambitious, as I tend to be with writing. It wasn't enough to just put research together and then argue. I wanted to build a narrative. The narrative pieces of the paper, then, would follow a 'David vs. Goliath' archetype with a Greek mythology aesthetic. I believe it was quite successful, and it it perhaps the most interesting paper I have written so far.

For context, the dogmatic Noam Chomsky had formulated a theory that humans have an innate grammar[^1] scaffold and languages differ because they turn options (or parameters) of that *Universal Grammar* on or off. For example, English and Spanish come from the same innate, human Universal Grammar, but we differ in that Spanish turned on the 'subject drop' option. Hispanohablantes can say `Yo como` or `Como` for "I eat", but English speakers must always say `I eat`.
</p>

This theory went through multiple revisions until they landed on "all languages have recursion." This is the universal part. Recursive language is when we embed a phrase within another phrase. For example, `Bob fished` can use recursion to say `Bob the fisherman fished` which can then be done again with `Bob the fisherman who lives in Paris fished` and this can be done infinitely with more and more phrases.

This time with the research paper was one of great literacy growth. I learned to construct a narrative (although I had help with other sources, naimly [Thomas Wolfe](https://harpers.org/archive/2016/08/the-origins-of-speech/)'s “The Origins of Speech: In the beginning was Chomsky” and [K Kelin](https://youtu.be/g14EvDDhgpE?si=dmGKEoXnlj5h4-ZX)'s "The Battle of the Linguists"). I learned to better organize an argument and to better integrate evidence. These skills are most helpful academically. Most importantly, however, I gained a better feel for my style, and I learned even more how to create a story.

Daniel L Everett comes along and finds a languages that doesn't have recursion. Chomsky is a dogmatic goliath in the field. Many linguists are loyal to him and his theories. A scholarly battle ensues.

Building a narrative like such is perhaps the common thread between all my high school works. I always wanted to tell a story. I still do. It was never enough to just 'say it how it is.' I do better with school when I can construct narratives around what I learn. When a class is disconnected from this narrative, it makes it hard to put total, energized effort into it.

I find that when I write in the absence of a story, I feel unattached to the work. I've felt this way during much of college as many of the essay prompts are quite rigid. They seem mostly to be a test of skill and comprehension rather than of invention and creativity.

In philosophy, for example, many philosophers will use thought experiments that are really just a form of storytelling. These thought experiments exemplify the argument or theory. It makes the argument clearer to the reader. It puts the theory into action. Some philosophers do not do this, though, and those articles are always quite dull.

<p>I enjoyed my philosophy textbook quite a lot (*Archetypes of Wisdom* by Douglas J. Soccio) because it painted a picture. Now, when I think about David Hume, I can conjure in my mind a setting where he exists. Maybe this isn't the business of philosophy, but I want to make it my business.</p>

In reflection, I find in my writing literacy a want for explanation—a making sense of the world through narrative. I've come a long way from then til now.

[^1]: Grammar in this context is not really rules like "don't split infinitives". Instead, innate grammar is the implict rules that any speaker of the same language will commonly use to construct sentences or phrases.
