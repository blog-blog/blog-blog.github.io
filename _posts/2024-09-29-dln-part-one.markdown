## Introduction
Welcome to my Digital Literacy Narrative. I want you to imagine something for a moment. Imagine someone deeply private. They love people, and they love friendship, of course. They're not misanthropic, no. This privacy isn't wrought from distrust or past trauma; it's just the way they are.

Imagine this applied to literacy. We might think of literacy more in the sense of self expression and away from a socially grand "[Literacy Myth](https://www.jstor.org/stable/367835)." Ask, what purpose does writing have for me? How does reading make me feel? In these ways, literacy would fall under that privacy umbrella. It would be hidden away—think the dead of night—private reading and private emotion, private writing and private expression. Don't think of this person as socially inept or socially anxious. Depending on who you are, reader, you might even love to be friends with this seemingly normal, expressive person.

We all have our own secret desires and secret anxieties, our secret fantasies and perhaps our secret hates. This private literacy isn't much different than that. It's not that this literacy *can't* be public. It's just the current truth that it is not. Ask yourself, is there something about myself that I keep a secret, and I could tell others (and probably with no repercussions), and yet I don't? If you can answer yes, then it is perhaps to you that I write.

## 2016
Remember this year? In some ways, for many people, it was the calm before the storm. It's an election year, and the following January would spell a new inauguration. At the end of 2016 would be my political awakening, which was 6th grade, the 2016-2017 academic year. Yet this took place in fifth grade, 2015-2016. At the time I was 9, almost 10. I'm attempting to recollect all that happened those years. I'm receiving bits and pieces.

In a previous version of this, I knew I was 9, but I was thinking that placed me in third grade. Now that I know it doesn't, it recontextualizes a lot. It places the event of which I will speak butting up against the transition from elementary to middle school. This transition, though, wasn't exactly revolutionary. I had the same friends, it was the same school building, but there was definitely an intellectual growth, especially with my reading abilities, even if there was no situational transition. I believe that in the next year, I would read *A Song of Ice and Fire* by George R.R. Martin, and *The Hobbit*, kicking off (among other books) my love for fantasy.

I think of literacy as a slowly building process. For me, it parallels a continually evolving sense of identity. The shock waves from either process (literacy and identity) ripple the line of the other. Sometimes, they coincide, and then we have a revolutionary event.

So it had to have been January. I was 9, then some weeks later I would be 10. Prior to then, I had been reading the first two books of *His Dark Materials* by Philip Pullman. For Christmas, I would receive the series box set. I was probably quite excited. Even now, I love being gifted books.

Imagine a cold, wet, gloomy Illinois winter. The sun sometimes shines bright, but even then the light is still cool. It was probably snowy, and if it wasn't, the world was all grey. Winter can have a depressed attitude. I've tried to capture this winter feeling many times in writing, and maybe it stems from the event of that year.

However, also think of a warm home decorated for Christmas. Perhaps there's something sweet to eat, and maybe there's a fire in the fireplace. There's definitely at the least the memory of Christmas music, seeing as this takes place after the holiday. This, too, is also a feeling I've tried capturing in writing.

Representing a break from school, time with family, and the winter-Christmas aesthetic, these times in my childhood were always important.

The book set I mentioned receiving was that of *His Dark Materials*. I'm not sure how well known the name of that series is. The titles are *The Golden Compass*, *The Silver Knife*, and *The Amber Spyglass* all by [Philip Pullman](https://philip-pullman.com/). In fact, the first book was brought to the big screen, and later the whole trilogy was [turned into television](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5607976/). The trilogy itself was written somewhat as a response to the religiosity of C. S. Lewis' *The Chronicles of Narnia*. By the final book *The Amber Spyglass*, there was a darker, sadder and explicitly antireligous tone. It's been a while since I've read all three books. Really, I've only read them all once although I've read the first a few times. The final book has the greatest criticism of the story of Adam and Eve. It reconstructs Original Sin not as sinful, but as wondrous and a delight of human nature.

*The Atlantic*'s [Hanna Rosin](https://web.archive.org/web/20201210163110/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/12/how-hollywood-saved-god/306444/) writes in December, 2007 with the release of *The Golden Compass* movie:

> A few scenes later, Lyra, alone in the woods with her friend Will, lifts a little red fruit “gently to his mouth.” They bump together clumsily, and Will is soon described … “kissing her hot face over and over again, drinking in with adoration the scent of her body,” his nerves “ablaze.” … The scene is intended as a rewriting of Genesis, with Lyra replaying the role of Eve … When critics accused Pullman of sanctioning underage sex, he said: “Nowhere in the book do I talk about anything more than a kiss. And as a child, a kiss is enough. A kiss can change the world.” What the novel says is, “Around them there was nothing but silence, as if all the world were holding its breath.”

In this book, God is a charlatan. He dies without dignity, a husk of an entity that claimed himself the creator because 'Dust' made him first. Dust is the power of the world. It clusters around people transitioning into puberty because it's a time of awakening, and it continues to gather as people use their conscious to think, reflect, build knowledge, and share knowledge. It's a holistic reimagining of a divine power. It's also allegedly the source of sin, and the Church wants to destroy it.

9-year-old me didn't fully understand this religious commentary or the human sexuality commentary. I did understand, though, the heartbreaking ending. I did understand the romantic love. I did understand that concept of 'awakening'. I remember how the description of his nerves "ablaze" made me feel uneasy—still, even now. 

*Skip the next paragraph if you don't want to read spoilers.*

Lyra (the main character) and Will are from different worlds. Holes between worlds let Dust leak, and that's bad. They also can't stay in a world that is not their home. They are also in love. They then have to separate. Never to see each other again. They agreed to sit at the their respective benches in the Oxford Botanical Gardens in their worlds at each midsummer's day. Below is that bench in our world.

As I'm writing this, some of what 9-year-old me felt is coming back. I was utterly devastated. I venture even to say depressed.

Imagine again a gloomy winter, a grade-school kid slumped on his bed, staring at a blank wall, and his heart ripped out from reading words on a page. He searches the internet for "the meaning" of the ending. He searches, "Do Lyra and Will ever meet again?" At some point he finds fan fiction from [AO3.org](https://archiveofourown.org/)[^fanfiction]. How fun! I was essentially obsessed and practically grieving over a fictional love that of course wasn't even mine. Suffice to say, it was a truly revolutionary work.

## In Reflection
So what does this have to say about literacy affecting identity and vice versa? What does any of this have to do with privacy?

No one in my life knew about my reaction. Really, my reading literacy life was, and is, a private one. I would read, and I would keep my feelings to myself. That's not to say I will never share my reading life with anyone. Here and there I'd divulge a little; there are very few people that get that window.

And now this DLN is going on the open web. Anyone could read it if they just use enough of the correct search terms. I would rather not be vulnerable. I'm more protective, secretive. I moonlight with deep emotions. It's for notebooks shoved into a draw. It's for digital documents protected by encryption and two passwords. The metaphorical moon light is for *cathartic* reading.

Perhaps that is because words are so powerfully moving. Now I see the power those words on a page had over me, and maybe that's why I avoid rereading the trilogy even today. I'm afraid to awaken that power and become depressed all over again from those words. Or maybe I'm afraid to find that the power is now gone. I don't think it's gone, though. Literary power can cause any emotion. I would say that most often it is a catharsis or a way to cope[^media]. Many can relate to feeling melancholy at a story's end. Many have laughed at a book, cried with a movie, or felt happy with a show. *His Dark Materials* was the first though: the awakening.

When words can capture our nature and our lives, they gain influence. They become more than just a book, and they begin to influence our identity. Here, literacy connects with identity. Literature—art—can mirror us, teach us, open us up. Those words could represent romance, oppression, connection, dread…

I think of *Cabaret* displaying the complacency of people in the face of rising fascism, *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl* by Harriet Jacobs showing human evil but also human partnership, and *The Chalice and The Blade* by Riane Eisler giving a new interpretation for oppression.

I think of *Our Flag Means Death* or *Heartstopper*, giving TV a representative gay love story. I think similarly of *Good Omens*, the serialized *Tales of the City* by Armistead Maupin, and *The Song of Achilles* by Madeline Miller. 

I think of all that media that has contributed to my literacy[^read]: the literacy (or the understanding) of emotion.

So if you found any relation to the private vulnerability in my introduction, consider what it could mean to the person sharing with you their latest read. If they share their emotional reaction, consider the window you might be seeing into their identity. Be compassionate. To some, making public the private is not a source of discomfort. For others, it is. For me, it is.
