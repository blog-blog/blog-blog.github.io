My bookshelf is quite sparse although I do have two other and not-pictured shelves. I mostly read from the library.

My first urge was to make this some big deeply philosophy piece of work. I wrote about a paragraph or two, but then I thought, "I really don't like this." But why not? The style was consistent with some of my most favorite works I've written, so what makes that style, *that mode*, inconsistent with this narrative?

I don't think it really captures who I actually am. Honestly, I love that academic mode (and I'll even have some excerpts in the [second post in the series]()), but some of the pieces I love the most are faster paced, more of a staccato cadence of humor. This won't be that, but I think it serves my narrative better to make this closer to that, even if it isn't completely that. Also, who cares about grammar in a blog? Grammar will do whatever serves me best. Down with the grammar prescriptivists! (I think that's the linguist in me peeking out, and maybe also the disappointment at the 'establishment'.[^1]) Who faults fiction writers for not being grammatically correct? Not that this is fiction.

This is meant to be non-fiction, but it also requires me to dramatize events in my life that really were not dramatic. Crush them into one singular event (like trying to gather a goopy dough ball into one whole mass), sure, all the events which I will talk about later were… dramatic revolutions!

They're really more of a slow burn: think many months.

With this first event though, I've kinda been lying because it was dramatic. I also don't think I've told anyone this. Many times I even forget this happened.

It had to have been January. Putting the pieces together, I received the book set for Christmas, but I had already finished the second (of three) book. Is it likely I'd have finished the third book in six days? I was perhaps 9 or 10.

Imagine a cold, wet, gloomy Illinois winter. The sun may shine bright at times, but even when it does the light looks cold. Somehow the summer sun is more intense, hotter, warmer in color. So the opposite of that. It was probably snowy, and if it wasn't, the world was wet and all grey. The world has a depressed attitude, is what I'm getting at. I've tried to capture this winter feeling many times in writing. Maybe it stems from the event of that year.

Also think of a warm home, decorated for Christmas. Perhaps there's something sweet to eat, and maybe there's a fire in the fireplace. There's definitely at the least the memory of Christmas music, seeing as this takes place after the holiday. This, too, is also a feeling I've tried capturing.

Representing a break from school, time with family, and the winter-Christmas aesthetic, these times in my childhood were always important.

The bookset I mentioned recieving was that of *His Dark Materials*. I'm not sure how well known the name of the series is. The titles are *The Golden Compass*, *The Silver Knife*, and *The Amber Spyglass* all by [Philip Pullman](https://philip-pullman.com/). In fact, the first book was brought to the big screen, and later the whole trilogy was [turned into television](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5607976/). The trilogy itself was written somewhat as a response to the religiosity of C. S. Lewis' *The Chronicles of Narnia*. By the final book *The Amber Spyglass* there was a more darker, sadder and explicitly antireligous tone. It's been a while since I've read all three books. Really, I've only read them all once although I've read the first a few times. The final book has the greatest criticism of the story of Adam and Eve. It reconstructs Original Sin not as sinful, but as wondrous and a delight of human nature.

*The Atlantic*'s [Hanna Rosin](https://web.archive.org/web/20201210163110/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/12/how-hollywood-saved-god/306444/) writes in December, 2007 with the release of *The Golden Compass* movie:

> A few scenes later, Lyra, alone in the woods with her friend Will, lifts a little red fruit “gently to his mouth.” They bump together clumsily, and Will is soon described … “kissing her hot face over and over again, drinking in with adoration the scent of her body,” his nerves “ablaze.” … The scene is intended as a rewriting of Genesis, with Lyra replaying the role of Eve … When critics accused Pullman of sanctioning underage sex, he said: “Nowhere in the book do I talk about anything more than a kiss. And as a child, a kiss is enough. A kiss can change the world.” What the novel says is, “Around them there was nothing but silence, as if all the world were holding its breath.”

In this book, God is a charlatan. He dies without dignity, a husk of an entity that claimed himself the creator because 'Dust' made him first. Dust is the power of the world. It clusters around people transitioning into puberty because it's a time of awakening, and it continues to gather as people use their conscious to think, reflect, build knowledge, and share knowledge. It's a holistic reimagining of a divine power. It's also allegdly the source of sin, and the Church wants to destroy it.

9-year-old me didn't fully understand this religious commentary or the human sexuality commentary. I did understand, though, the heartbreaking ending. I did understand the romantic love. I did understand that concept of 'awakewning'. I remember how the descriptiong of his nerves "ablaze" made me feel uneasy—still, even now. 

*Skip the next paragraph if you don't want to read spoilers.*

Lyra (the main character) and Will are from different worlds. Holes between worlds lets Dust leak, and that's bad. They also can't stay in a world that is not their home. They are then in love. They then have to separate. Never to see eachother again. They agreed to sit at the their respective benches in the Oxford Botanical Gardens in their worlds at each midsummer's day. Below is that bench in our world.

As I'm writing this, some of what 9-year-old me felt is coming back. I was utterly devastated. I venture even to say depressed. However, it was the perfect time for me to read it, as I was in a similar life position as the characters.

Imagine a gloomy winter again, a grade-school kid sitting on his bed, his heart ripped out from reading words on a page. He searches on the internet for 'the meaning' of the story. He searches 'do Lyra and Will meet again?' He finds fan fiction of people wanting something similar. I was obssessed, I was practically grieving a fictional love that wasn't even mine. In the end, though, that pain only went away with time. Suffice to say, it was a transformative work.

In reflection, I now see the power those words had over me. Simply, they were just words on a page. Maybe that's why I avoid rereading the entire trilogy again even today. I'm afraid to awaken that power. Or maybe I'm afraid to find that the power is now gone. I don't think it's gone, though, and I don't mean to say it's a  depressing power. This literary power could cause any emotion. Many can relate to feeling melancholy at a story's end. Many have laughed at a book, cried with a movie, felt happy with a show. I can point to more recent examples of the power of media. This was the first, though: the awakening.

No one in my life knew about my reaction. Really, my reading literacy life was a private one. I would read, and I would keep my feelings to myself. That's not to say I will never share my reading life with anyone. Some people here and there I would tell, but never tell all.

Writing, the topic of the second part, has been more expressive, mostly because it has been forced into a more public mode. Look at this blog, for example, pretend instead of me writing it, I was somehow reading it into existence. I would share it with no one. If it was written on paper, I would share it with no one.

School has always forced me to relinquish a piece of my private self. In reflection, I realize this. This DLN is going on the open web. Anyone could read it if they just use enough of the correct search terms. In reflection, I would rather not be vulnerable. I'm more protective, secretive. I moonlight with deep emotions. It's not for the light. It's for notebooks shoved into a draw. It's for digital documents protected by encryption and two passwords. The moon light is for reading and reaction to reading.

In reflection, I realize the power of words in capturing human nature, human emotion. I realize the power of words in representing romance, human connection, and oppression and dread.

I think of *Cabaret*, displaying the complacency of people in the face of rising fascism.

I think of *Our Flag Means Death*, giving TV a gay love story, a truly representative one. I think similarly of *Good Omens*.

I think of the serialized *Tales of the City* by Armistead Maupin, *The Song of Achilles* by Madeline Miller, and I think of all that media that has contributed to my literacy: the literacy (or the understanding) of emotion.

These and the event of which I spoke give me that will to recognize the importance of literacy. Literacy, to me, is not that ultimate skill that guarantees a successful future. I've never thought of it like that. Beginning perhaps here, with *His Dark Materials*, I fully understand the power that literature[^2] has and by implication the power the skill *to create literature* gives me.

[^1]: This is quite funny to me. Some of the worse political turns in the world's history have come from young men being angry at the old men. They then remove the old men, and then the young men become just as oppressive and despotic as the old men. Masculinity! See *The Chalice and The Blade* by Riane Eisler.
[^2]: By literature, I don't mean canonical or classical works. By all means, I'm using it more loosely than I ought to to mean any written or even just artful work in any medium.
