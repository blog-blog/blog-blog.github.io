I'd like to write a little something for anything I particularly enjoy and do it primarily for my future self. Anything I write also lives locally on my computer, which is important, for (if I am my primary audience) I'd like to keep my read/watch records even if my online precense is nuked.

As for "report:" "review" is too serious and implies I am well-read or -watched enough to have any meaninful critques or commendments. I can say what I personally liked or disliked, though, and I can from time to time analyze the contents of a work. I am not a critic nor a reviewer, and I don't pretend to be. "Report" also illicits an association with school book reports, which I've never really written, but the reports here anyways are entirely informal. If I had ever written a book report, the reports here would be as I would have wanted to write them: unvarnished and however I want.

Sometimes I consider if these reports ought to live only locally or perhaps as social media posts. The benefit of using a git forge, however, is archival services. Online publishing has the benefit of sharing my thoughts to friends. The downside is scraping: my words going to feed the hungry, unintelligent machines (who allegedly "learn as humans" but can't replicate an author's style perfectly and can only do it imperfectly after ingesting their entire corpus… Is that "learning like a human?") I will say, however, that things are the internet do not "live forever." If it gets sucked up (lovingly) by the Internet Archive, then sure, it will live indefinitely. But the internet constantly rots away, and I'm not search engine optimized. Anyways… for the moment my blog will live online (on Microsoft servers), and hopefully in your RSS reader (as it does in mine).
