> I must write just what I have lived and witnessed myself … God … gave me a soul that burned for freedom, and a heart nerved with determination to suffer even unto death in pursuit of that liberty which without makes life an intolerable burden. —Harriet Jacobs

It's November 7th, and something has happened now that I wish hadn't. The worries of the many went unanswered, and so without honest truths, we have now a populist lie. The calls went unheard.

I've just finished up reading Jean F. Yellin's *Harriet Jacobs: A Life*. Jacobs's life was one of activism but also of broken promises. Her childhood and young-adulthood was lived with the lack of agency. She was a slave in Edenton, North Carolina. The man who owned her as property was a terrible man—there was no saving grace or a streak of "he owned slaves, but at least he was kind." He attempted to force her into concubinage. He was held off by Jacobs' grandmother, who had become a free woman and was respected in the town. Jacobs' master was only stayed by a waning sense of dignity within the Southern aristocracy.

This eventually ran out, and her master, Dr. James Norcom, disregarded the ramifications. It was Jacobs' late-night escape, her wily tactics of dodging her master, her eventual late-night escape, the help of a conspiracy who concealed her, and the partnership of those around her and her own cleverness and drive that delivered her North.

And yet, it was the unasked kindness of a Northern woman friend that would eventually pay for Jacobs' freedom rather than Jacobs seizing it for herself. The image of God, she wrote, was placed in a scale and weighed against the sum of three hundred dollars.[^incidents-263] So she is a freedwoman, insofar as a black woman can be free. 

She then wrote her narrative *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl*, and she became active in the abolitionist and First Wave feminist movements, yet she labored for the rest of her life: sometimes in other households, sometimes beneath her own name. She gave relief to refugees during the civil war, traveling to Alexandria next to the capital and Savannah, funding and running Asylums and schools, advocating for the freedmen and woman.

After the Civil War, there was some hope that America would uphold the ideal of equality. Then, when freedmen came to own the fields the used to work, came to run the buildings ran by the Evil Slavery, the government betrayed them and returned the property to the evil men who bonded them and who had fought against the Union. Then Lincoln was shot. Then Reconstruction was ended, and the Union soldiers left, and the powerful abandoned the South and the freedpeople there. The hope of equality died. In 1877, Jacobs wrote both about "… her own situation and … the realities … African Americans were facing in post-Reconstruction America" and "Instead of defiance, Jacobs's hand now traced an aphorism expressive of the resignation that characterized her grandmother Molly: 'Trust and be hopeful.'" Indeed, "Now all her dreams—of a home in freedom for her children, of her people free in their homes—lay shriveled and dead."[^a-life-228]

It is November 7th, and all I can say is trust and be hopeful. So far, the House still hangs in the balance. I can't say for how long. _(Update: The Republicans now hold a trifecta)_  It's very easy to despair. Part of me says, 'let it all burn down.' Let them win the House, the Senate, the Presidency, transform the Executive and the Judiciary, pass all those laws and orders which win destroy the economy and the American people. Only then, when those promises have been broken will those supporters realize the populist lie they've been told. Protectionism: install tariffs. High cost of living: remove the undocumented. Easy fixes for hard problems, right? The Democratic platform did not answer the pleas of the common American. The common American sees no threat to democracy, for economic comfort is more important than the Left's imagined calamity. I want economic comfort. But I also want to be free to love. I want freedom and equality for all America's peoples.

There is no comfort without rights, not even economic comfort. This is no economy worth living in without democracy, without worker protection, without [unionizing](https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/11/rip-jane-mcalevey/#organize). There has been no labor right that the oligarchs simply gave to us. They are inherently ours, and so we fight for our rights. Now, with a failure of imagination, let's fill in the gaps. Let it all burn, and the people will learn from the light of the fire.

The other part of me simply hopes for the best. The transformation of the Executive and the Judiciary could be solved with time and legislation, but how long? And who can predict if our nation will last long enough to find out? It's times like these where I become a federalist. Dubious legality disregarded, the states have a lot of power over themselves. Pretend we ban "sodomy" nationally. Perhaps a state bans the enforcement of that law and bans agencies from complying with the feds. It happens currently with immigration and Texas.

Perhaps we use the same dubious doctrine to instead protect the rights of our citizens. Perhaps we devolve into a civil war. Hopefully we do not, but not because we laid down and died, but because that which needed to be achieved was achieved without violence

[Kamala Harris said](https://www.youtube.com/live/WckEFzGku0Q?si=yIWD-c4UnnS9Rgq4&t=676) in her concession speech, "only when it is dark enough can you see the stars". There was a reaction in the crowd. It got worse for Harriet Jacobs before it got better. It got worse once again when the promises of equality were broken. It improved once more after her life. Perhaps it has never been so dark since the Civil War—at least not since the 1960s.

We equalize when we protest, when we come together, when we are partners. But how can I talk about unity in such times? I don't know how to unify or to act, but inaction is simply not enough.

Suffice to say, while I can trust and be hopeful all I want, it's still an aphorism of resignation and of lost defiance. Yet, it's all I'm capable of doing right now. Perhaps later—sometime soon—the defiance can begin: before the freedom of expression freezes over.

I must trust in a federal system and that our institutions are strong enough. I must be hopeful the darkness is not too deep, that I will see the full light again, not only the stars, in my country, within my lifetime.

On the night of the 5th, before going to bed, I said to myself, "Goodnight, America." The data was looking red, Georgia had been called, and I felt the impending announcement. Around 3:30AM, the election was called. Donald Trump will be the 47th president of the United States.

Harriet Jacobs died with her hopes unrealized. "She was no reed shaken by the wind, vacillating, easily moved from a position. She did her own thinking; had opinions of her own, and held to them with great tenacity."[^a-life-260] She then was forgotten, her memory outlived by Sojourner Truth, the Sybil, and Harriet Tubman, the Moses. Harriet Jacobs' narrative was radical for her time: asserting the unaffected rectitude of a woman with a sexual history. In fact, her account was ground breaking. Eventually, she was rediscovered, and now her narrative is read in schools across the country. Her life can be read as a manifesto, an inspiration, a call to action, a philosophy. She's not a Moses or a Sybil. I couldn't tell you what biblical archetype she is. However, I think she is an archetype of her own: the gylanizer[^eisler].

America has never seen a challenge like this, but it has seen many challenges. Despite the reality of what America and Americans might actually be, I still live here, and I am hopeful for a better future. I'm really not an optimist; in fact, I'm quite pessimistic about our chances. Maybe it is delusion, maybe it is rationalism, but I believe we have a good chance of prevailing.

I'm bombarded with quotes. *Without fear or favor*; *A republic, if you can keep it*. But I'm left with a question. Would Harriet Jacobs have ever imagined a Black woman would be so close to the presidency? And what does it say about our country, notwithstanding the loss, that _Vice President_ Harris had gotten so close to becoming the President of the United States?
