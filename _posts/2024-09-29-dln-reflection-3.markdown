## Which Elements to Incorporate and Why?

The first thing I had to do was narrow my topics or 'events'.

In my previous reflection, I discussed four events that demonstrated my literacy. The final two were more vague, however. They were really more like 'eras' (high school writings and post-high school writings). This makes it hard to give pertinent elements. My first event had no associated images although that booklet I made was real. For that, I'll have to dig through all the things my mom saved and see if she still has it.

To make my multimodal elements more impactful, I think I need to distill my events down to something more impactful. For example, my 'high school writings' event could be distilled down into just my research paper as it's the most impactful. I could then talk more specifically about that time, and I can also try to find more useful photos.

So before I show my elements, I want to refine my event list. I'm tempted to make 3 blog posts: One on literacy as it relates to my reading/consumption of art, one on writing, and the last on in-progress events.

So it could look something like this, with each new list item being a separate blog post:

1. *His Dark Materials* reaction & other literary reactions I can sprinkle in, such as my watching of the Mendes production of *Cabaret* 
2. The baby bird book, *A Story of Titles*, &  ENG101/high school research paper
3. Incidents project and how I envision my future.

Does this sound reasonable?

### Blog Post 1

Let's assume it is reasonable. 

The first image I will include is my *His Dark Materials* book set, followed by the library (Fossil Ridge) where I checked out the first version of it I read. The first image compliemnts the reader's understanding of my having read the books. The reader gets to connect a visual image to the thought "he read the books." This complements understanding. The second and third images satiate the reader's curiosity. If I mention the libraries *by name*, surely I ought to include a photo of the library itself.

I think captions themselves can be engaging for a reader, especially if the caption is funny. It gives the reader a brief aside—a resting point.

<p>
If I then talk about other literature, I should include a relevant element. For example, if I'm talking about *Cabaret*, I should have a video embed. Ideally, I would include video, audio, and images, but not everything I discuss can have all these.

### Blog post 2

If the second blog post is about written events, then I want to include physical examples of my writing if able. I can show a (quite bad) story from first grade (although the story in the image is not the same as the story I spoke of previously). I also might want to give representative quotes from my writing, but I'm not entirely sure. At the very least, it gives the reader something concrete about my writing to see where otherwise. I think if I ever find myself describing my writing, I should just give a quote. 

I shouldn't overdo it though. People don't want to read a lot of quoted text. Ideally, my first grade story would be handwritten, but somehow 1st grade me had his hands on a printer! My mom and I were goign through the stuff she kept, but there's so much, and I could only find a few things that were actually relevant. I think, though, that such old pieces of writing are engaging. It's reading into someone's past.

### Blog post 3
<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr">

This blog post is probably the hardest. It might seem strange to include something about the future, but so much is happening right now that without the present and future, the narrative is incomplete. I suppose the narrative is always incomplete until we pass, but this present time is such a transitional moment. As mentioned, I'll focus mostly on my project and what it means for my literacy. It also connects to my future quite easily.

But images.

So far the motif has been physical things, but this part has been digital so far. It could somehow focus on a literacy goal like being published (like in MELUS for my project). But how can I represent that?

I might include some screenshots of WIP works to give readers something to connect my words to. But still, that's just more text! I need to simmer more on engaging, visual elements that represent this stage of my literacy.

## Incoporating Elements
Semantically, I would like to have the elements be mentioned in an adjacent paragraph. For example, when I'm talking about *Cabaret*, I should place the *Cabaret* element right next to that paragraph, whether it be a video embed or associated promotional photographs.

Technically, these elements are a lot of work to incorporate into a Jekyll-generated blog. Vanilla markdown (or Jekyll's markdown flavor [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/)) doesn't support placement of multimedia elements. Or more technically, there is no such thing as a multi-axis layout in markdown *unless* you want to hack it with tables. This is undesirable for me. Therefore, I've had to dust off my HTML skills and hop into CSS territory.

For example, if I want to "right-align" a series of images, I have to write something like this:

```HTML
<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr">

<div>
 This text is displayed on the left side because it is the content of the first group in the grid.
</div>

<div>
<figure>
<img style="width:300px" align=center src="image.png" alt="my alt text"/>
<figcaption>
This creates an image caption
</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img style="width:300px" align=center src="image2.png" alt="my alt text"/>
<figcaption>
This creates an image caption
</figcaption>
</figure>
</figure>
</div>

</div>
```

"`<div>`" means nothing, it's just a way of grouping other elements. I then use CSS to tell the web renderer to display this as a grid with two columns. The first subgroup is place in column 1 (on the left), and the second subgroup is placed in column 2. So the first `div` group has text, and the second `div` group has my list of images, therefore making my images right aligned.

Under the hood, any image that has text wrapping around it has been done with something like this. 

## Reflection
I think I'm missing some images that would engage the reader, but I feel like I don't have anything like that. They feel somehow myopic—the represent *one* individual thing—and not completely representative of my narrative, but they might just have to do.
