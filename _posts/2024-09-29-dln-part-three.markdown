*Written for ASU's ENG 484 Writing Mentor Internship, this is the final part of a three part Digital Literacy Narrative. Find here [part one](dln-part-one) and [part two](dln-part-two).*

At minimum, those events I talked about in parts one and two were two years ago. It's now 2024, transitioning to 2025, so what's my literacy like now?

Well, I'm learning a lot of new skills, particularly concerning logic and philosophical argument. It's honestly quite ironic as just last year I was very much a skeptic of rational argument and logic. Now, I never disbelieved reason as a good thing, but I think David Hume was right when he said reason is the slave of passion. We reason based off our wills and wants, so what more can we do than understand our passion?

Gloria Anzalduá's *Borderlands*, Riane Eisler's *The Chalice and the Blade*, other feminist pieces, and an assortment of Eastern philosophy got me to begin questioning the primacy of logic and reason. Doubtless they are useful tools, but those tools can just as easily 'prove' that something immoral should happen. Atrocities have been done in the name of reason. Is this just a bastardization of reason, or is it just the nature of a flexible tool?

I'm in a more cognizant linking stage of knowledge at the moment. I find something, read something, and then connect it to some other thing. I use a note-taking software called Obsidian which I also use for planning and TODOs. You can also create links to other notes. You can then play an animation of those linkages over time.

Knowledge is always growing. In particular, I have an ever-growing knowledge concerning one subject which has been ongoing for about a year now. It's a personal project about Harriet Jacob's *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl* and how it can be reinterpreted as a timeless manifesto for gylanzing[^1], equalizing, or connectedness.

So it's a great period of growth, but I think school sometimes slows that down. I have a lot of interests that I have to put aside for school. At this point in my degree, most of my classes are at least focused *on* that interest of the degree, but many times I would rather be focusing on my most impassioned interests.

I'd like to be reading more for my *Incidents* Project, but it seems there's a never-ending supply of school work. And then when I don't have work, I'm too mentally exhausted to complete anything!

I must remind myself that my literacy growth has often happened during or coincidng with school. The Project for example grew out of an essay I wrote for my Multi-Ethnic Literature class. I then became inspired to further it along.

I hope to see in my future—and perhaps I'll go so far as to predict—that I get an essay published. Hopefully, it will be the *Incidents* essay (I could really talk about that for so long).

I plan to be a Public Policy Analyst or something associated, and that role required me to research and write. What is happening now with my literacy will build me up to that.

This is all quite specific, though. I titled this final part *En Media Res* because it is quite literally in the middle of things. A lot is happening at the moment. For all I know, I'm forced to drop out of college or I forget to read tomorrow. So with broad strokes, I see in my future a continual growth and utilization of my literacy.

I don't find literacy a direct tool for success. I don't find my literacy skills inherently define me. However, what I produce, what I create, *does* define me. Or more accurately, it is a translation of what happens internally and mentally. It's an expression. It's self-actualization to read and write.

I'd wager that since humans could speak we've been telling stories. If so, then storytelling is intrinsically human. We don't need the written word for that, but it is my medium of choice.

So it's a period of great transition. A spatial transition from Illinois to Arizona, a situational transition from high school to college, a life transition from teenage to adulthood, and it is a literary transition, one of constant growth. 

A literacy narrative really never ends as long as we live. We build in our memories a narrative of our lives. And so I'm cautiously excited to see where my literacy goes from here.


[^1]: This comes from the aforementioned *The Chalice and The Blade*. It's part of a social systems theory. You have one mode of society which values domination and hierarchies, an androcracy. And you have another model of society which values partnership and linking (relationships), a gylany. We've been struggling in an androcractic world since the neolithic, with societies sometimes gylanizing.
