A literacy narrative requires that we include and exclude events from the narrative. We can hide what we don't want to share and share what we think makes us look best. I think I've done a balancing act. Sure, writing was much easier for me than for others, but I've struggled in other ways in my life nonetheless. 

Recall a struggle. How did it change you? Reflect, how did it make you feel at the time? Many writers struggle with self-doubt. I know I have. Have you?

Literacy is continual, and my opinions on the matter have steered up and then dipped down. I've had to consider my skills and my current limits, but I've also had to give myself perspective. Literacy does not exist in isolation, and it's not even the only form of expression. There's much that defines me—or any of us—than just our ability to read and write.

Sometimes when I have to read a dense philosophy article, I feel frustrated by my inability to grasp concepts. I get so hyper-focused on my abilities in *that* moment with *that* particular style of writing that I feel some big personal failing. But literacy is always developing. We're always learning. My philosophy teacher can read these articles effortlessly, but does she deride her students for failing to understand? No. She may have better skills, but 'superiority' is never an excuse to disparage. It's also not an excuse to do the same to yourself. We must gives ourselves grace, and we must give others grace, especially if they are less "developed" in literacy.

## On *En Media Res*
A shift has occurred between high school and college. At first, it came upon me slowly. Now, I feel less confident in my writing. This may be just a function of writing in new formats, or perhaps it's something else entirely. Whatever it may be, I'm generally hopeful that confidence will return. With new formats comes new skills, but those skills must first be learned. When I was writing the Universal Grammar essay, it required a degree of research I wasn't used to. In college, I've been able to do better research and with more confidence. It's simply a matter of time.

This shift, furthermore, exemplifies a feature of literacy: for as long as we live, the narrative continues. Until now, I can quite cleanly separate the narrative into eras often delineated by school. A proto-literacy pre-fifth grade, a growing literacy in middle school, a flourishing literacy in high school, and a continually developing literacy in college.

Much of my current literacy has been focused on philosophical thought and composition. It's also the case that I've been sympathetic to Eastern[^holistic] and feminist[^feminism] philosophies, which are often quite different to mainstream Western philosophy. However, they're not entirely different beasts. They come with their own sets of foundational beliefs, but they interact in the same 'discussion': responses to responses to response. Feminist philosophy can be skeptical about reasoning, for example, because too often rationalization (or quieting cognitive dissonance) looks like reasoning. But then again, David Hume, a mainstream and Western philosopher, said reason is the slave of passion.

What I took for granted is now questioned. What is questioned opens possibilities for new beliefs. It's a conflicted overhaul, but in the future I will be able to reflect on it. However in the moment, it allows for self-doubt and especially self-doubt with literacy: the importance of it and my skills with it.

## Writing Mentorship

Amid all of this is a new job. The College of Integrated Arts and Sciences at Arizona State University operates a "Writers' Lab" comprised of first year composition courses. I've talked of the need of compassion and sensitivity. Now as a Writing Mentor, I've had to practice a bit what I preach.

If I have self-doubt and hesitancy at publicity, surely many other students do as well. I have to make sure I'm not domineering (students deserve ownership over their works) and that I guide students towards their self-intended end points and not *my* end points.

This has caused me to reflect on my relationships with teachers. I've found that I have always had amazing English teachers, and without them, I would not be where I am today. Not in skill and not in life situation.

I've also been practicing new skills, like making infographics and public (digital) speaking. I've had to interact with students, a new dynamic as I'm technically 'above' them in authority (although I don't consider myself a superior).

## *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl*

I've also been involved with a personal project centered on Riane Eisler's Cultural Transformation Theory (CTT) detailed in *The Chalice and The Blade* and Harriet Jacobs' life and *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl*. In the latter, Jacobs' purpose is to move Northern white women to abolitionism. With her autobiography she builds a public and political identity, and she asserts a freed woman's moral rectitude. In affect, her autobiography is a manifesto of feminist equalizing. My project argues this and calls Jacobs' manifesto timeless and relevent.

In her narrative, there's a struggle between her and her master where he wants to sexually assault her but is stopped by Southern aristocratic decency politics.[^decency] This 'decency' eventually runs out, and Jacobs details an encounter between her and a white lawyer. She is pregnant and then gives birth. She is with this man to thwart her master. Jacobs is successful in preventing the worst, but she eventually goes into hiding for seven years in an attic. She escapes to the North, and then builds her life in abolitionist, literary, and feminist circles. She also aids refugees during the Civil War. However, much of her efforts to equalize the South after the War fail.

In her narrative, she makes public something 'immoral:' her inter-racial relationship and pre-marital sex. This was at a time where enslaved women were viewed as defiled, licentious 'creatures.' However, she asserts that she was moral in her evasive maneuvers. Yet, she never details her and the lawyer's intimate moments. In her narrative, she is vulnerable in making some of her life public, but there are those events still that she keeps private. They're meant only for her.

When we read the narratives of others, we have room to interpret a lot. And as a reader, we must interpret the reasons why the author included or excluded certain events. But how can we know what they excluded?

I've centered myself on a few major events in my literacy development. I've excluded nearly everything, then. There are parts I could include with this *en media res* as there is a lot happening with me right now, and a lot of it relates to literacy. But I didn't include it, so why? Some of it seems irrelevant (such as my learning a second language), some of it seems unimportant.

However, for a narrative—and a *public* narrative—some events are too private or too vulnerable, too diatribe-like or too charged. I could probably give a dozen stories similar to the *His Dark Materials* story from the first part.

For a moment, I want to touch on tangential developments to literacy. Literacy is not only influenced by reading and writing, especially if we consider it a subset of identity. Identity, and by implication literacy, is influenced by TV shows, movies, plays, *music*, and other art. And that is *just* art. Identity is also influenced by relationships, introspection, environment, culture, and perhaps a million others things.

A literacy narrative is a divergence of a life narrative and is necessarily isolated for brevity. Just know that someone's literacy is influence by the sum of all their life events.

I display two artistic creations of mine. This isn't literacy, but art influences me in some way nonetheless. So does baking, so does the music I listen to, and so does (at least to some degree) playing video games, especially those I play with friends and family.

Take for example Harriet Jacobs again. She feared publicity (at first) not because of some innate desire for privacy, but because the religious and cultural morals at the time dictated her immoral. Her vulnerability, caused by her environment, is obvious.

It helps to understand someone's background to understand their desires for privacy, their discomfort in publicity, and the vulnerabilities in their literacy.

## Ending with a Note
I've wanted to sanitize this narrative. I don't want to appear neurotic (as there is definitely something to be said about my deep desire for privacy). I could intellectualize it, psychoanalyze it, and I could even give a few simple words about what motivates that desire for privacy. But I won't.

Instead, I'd like to summarize. When people write, they include and exclude, sometimes from being too personal and too vulnerable; people have backgrounds which again can expose vulnerabilities; people might open windows to their inner-selves when sharing writing or reading; and when people publicize essentially anything that is personal, they open themselves up to criticism of their identity.

With that being said, consider the potential consequences of your own words. They could rip someone down or they could build someone up. People give you trust when they share. Maybe you are among the subset of people that spontaneously extend trust in order to share vulnerable writing and reading. If you are, it is in fact to you that I write. 

Additionally, it is easy to lose yourself in your own head and fail to consider the individuals around you. Use your own experiences as a source of empathy when you have the power of trust and judgment.

Finally, I've perhaps painted a melodramatic picture of public literacy. In real life, it often doesn't look like someone is having a grand war between their public and private self. It really often isn't that deep of a struggle for me. In fact, by the time someone shares a personal work, it might already be whitewashed or distilled or sanatized. I implore that you just be aware of the *potential* vulnerabilities someone might open when trusting you when they share. Also be aware of the power you have when you have that trust. So far, I haven't been disappointed when extending that trust. Perhaps that can be a source of hope, but I must admit I've been quite selective. I also preemptively form a tough shell, bracing for impact.

Always try to have some perspective.

I end with thanks. Thank you for making it this far, especially if it was not, in fact, to you that I write.

… continue on to the [final note](dln-4) if you're just hankering for more.
## End Notes
[^decency]: Jacobs recognizes that she had it better than most other enslaved women. Her slave master only hesitated because Jacobs' free grandmother was respected in the town.
[^holistic]: Such as Laozi, the legendary writer of a foundational text on Dao. This is the "Way" which empathizes harmony, compassion, and humility among other things. The TV shows *Avatar: The Last Airbender* is largely based on Chinese mythology and is one of my favorites, especially the character Iroh.
[^feminism]: Especially Chicana feminist philosophy, such as Anzaldúa Gloria.
