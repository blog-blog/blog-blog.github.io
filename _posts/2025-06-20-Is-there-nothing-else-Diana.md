*Spoilers!*

Edward White ends *Dianaworld* with an anecdote. A visitor to Althorp (the ancestral home of the Spencers) remarked dismayed that there was so little Diana memorabilia: that's why she came to Althorp at all. She asks her companion, “Is there nothing else Diana? *Is that it?*”

This sentence ends the book.

A reader might have a similar question: *Is that it? Is that how the book ends?* But I think it's a perfect ending to the chapter (the one about the reactions to Diana's death and the decades following) and to the book. One may ask that question about all of Diana's life: *Was that really all it? Now that she is dead?* For being such a popular figure, it is jarring for that thread to be cut so soon and so sudden. But really, the previous question must be about her *lifetime* and not her lived life itself. To ask that about her life would be absurd, but I think that second meaning of the visitor's question taken out of context is the demanding, unfair expactations that were placed on Diana. This interpretation echoes the previous paragraph containing a quote from Tanya Gold.

> “I always thought of Diana as an addict, her emotions a slipstream. She was unanchored, open to all ideas, even witchcraft. She had the self-absorption, the craftiness, the hunger for love, the fury, the mercurial kindness and the self-hatred of the addict.”
