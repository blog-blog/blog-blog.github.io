Coming from *Andor* and wanting desperately to read more about Mon Mothma, I came across *The Mask of Fear*. It's the first part of a trilogy yet to come. After reading *Mask*, I wait (im)paitently for the next two installments.

At first, the point-of-view was a bit jarring, with thoughts and feelings being narrated, but I came to appreciate it; it's different than a TV show, of course, but it has its own strengths. We get to see inside the minds of characters. We also get to see delightful dissonances: Bail not believing in Mon's plan. Mon not believing in Bail's plan. Both being so convicted that they are right. Characters sharing their negative perceptions of Mon. Mon sharing her changing perception of herself.

I'm not much of a critic, but I can tell when a book holds my attention, and I can tell when I'm suprised by its depth, and intelligence, and story-crafting. *Mask* is excellent and ellegantly sewn together.

As [Tony Gilroy said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-sI-Iz_zyo) about *Andor*, we already know where the story ends, but it's liberating to work inside those constraints. We already know what happens to Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and Saw Gerrera, but it's fun to see the in-between.

## Mon Mothma

*I'm a certified Mon Mothma-fanatic. As such I focus mainly on her.*

The Mon Mothma in *The Mask of Fear* is outwardly the same as the Mon we see in *Andor*: a pesky "establishment" Senator who supports annoying causes without the popularity or means to forward them. In *Mask*, Mon is called a hypocrite and calls *herself* a hypocrite.

Still, I found the establishment aspect surprising in *Mask* because I was introduced to the rebel-Mon Mothma. It also brings to mind a Nancy Pelosi-type. Which isn't exactly how I'd like to think of a beloved character, but I think she is “establishment” not because she licks the boots of the “elites,” but because she believes too much in the government's power to do good. Because she is not populist, and she is a pragmatist, she is viewed as an establishment politician. As we see by the end of this book, that belief begins to waiver.

In *Mask*, we see Mon playing again with politics as she did with the Alliance of Two Thousand. Again she failed—sort of. And from that failure, we begin to see her move away from politics and to a rebellion (at least on the inside). On the outside, she is resolved to “remain Senator Mon Mothma of Chandrila” (463) as it is all she had to give. In the background, however, she had already met with Saw Gerrera, and altough in *Andor*'s “Welcome to the Rebellion” we see a Mon Mothma shocked at Cassian shooting and killing people in front of her, we learn in *Mask* she has already killed a man—though from afar.

That is all to say it is easy to see how she went from *Mask*'s establishment-Mon to *Andor*'s rebel-Mon. She's deeply pragmatic, which leads to dubious ethical decisions. Yet her ideal remains in democracy even when her belief in government waivers.

Literally gun to her head, Mon said she would sacrifice herself and the entirety of Chandrila if it meant preserving democracy. To Mon, the preservation of democracy matters more than the will of the people. In *Andor*, it meant more than the needs of her family. In *Mask*, it meant more than loyalty to her friends and allies and more than the command not to murder.

Sacrificing Chandrila and its 2 billion inhabitants is quite extreme, and she says that as a means to an important end, so perhaps she doesn't believe that absolutely. But it's easy to see that through-line: to care so much about democracy, to trying to wield beauracracy to save it, and then to lead the Rebellion in order to reestablish it—all the while making ethically dubious and undemocratic moves—shows a Mon 

Even before the full-on rebel-Mon, she alread sees the limits of using the government to save the government. But that doesn't mean she gave up hope for the ideal beneficence of democracy. She's also not illusioned that the previous Republic was all that great.

In that way, she aligns with the galaxy's populace. The flaws of the Republic lead to the Clone Wars. The people know war, and welcome Palpatine's fascistic peace. But the rebels know, and soon many within the population will know, that armistice is not necessarily peace: that a government can wage a quiet war on its own citizens.

It was easy for me to get lost in the girl-boss-mon-uniting-the-rebels aspect of her character, but of course, she's more-flawed and more-human than that. For the pursuit of an ideal world, how much will we sacrifice?

## Hopes for the Future
I love political intrigue. It's what draws me to Star Wars: I'm more a fan of its world-building than any of its particular stories. But of course, I was drawn to *Andor* and the political workings of the Rebellion and the Empire.

Watching *Andor*, I thought: *If it could be written and directed as greatly as* Andor *was, then I'd love to see a Mon Mothma prequel, and a Luthen Rael prequel.* I think: *How did they meet?*

*The Mask of Fear* answers some of that, but it doesn't cover much ground. It tells the origins (really more the sowing of the seeds) of rebellion.

That's not exactly a negative, but it makes me hungry for the rest of *Reign of the Empire*, and I hope the next installments cover more ground (and perhaps introduces us to the origins of Luthen and Kleya's operations).

## Verdict
Love.
